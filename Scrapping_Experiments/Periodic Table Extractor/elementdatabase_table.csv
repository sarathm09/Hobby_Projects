1,Hydrogen,H,1.0079,"Hydrogen  and the most abundant and lightest element of all. It constitutes about 75 percent of the elemental mass in the universe. Hydrogen, found in plasma state, is the main element in the composition of stars in the main sequence. On earth, hydrogen occurs relatively rare in nature. It is the main component of all organic matter and water. Industrial production of hydrogen takes place by steam reforming of natural gas. Electrolysis of water and other energy-intensive hydrogen production techniques are less often used. In terms of chemical properties, molecular hydrogen or dihydrogen (hydrogen gas) is highly flammable. It burns in air in different concentrations, ranging from 4 percent up to 75 percent by volume. Explosive mixtures form with air in concentration between 4 and 74 percent. Concentration of 5 to 95 percent forms explosive mixtures with chlorine. Ultraviolet light is emitted by pure hydrogen-oxygen flames, and they are almost invisible to the naked eye. The use of flame detector may be required to detect burning hydrogen leaks, and leaks like these can be dangerous. Under normal conditions, hydrogen is an insipid, odorless, and colorless gas, which is made of diatomic molecules. The hydrogen atom has one electron and one unit of positive charge in the nucleus. The atomic weight of hydrogen is 1,00797 g/mol. Three isotopes of hydrogen have been observed, deuterium, protium, and tritium. They can be produced artificially through a variety of nuclear reactions and occur in small quantities in nature. Regarding industrial applications, hydrogen is used in the synthesis of ammonia. Hydrogen is also used in sulphur elimination and fuel refinement, for example, hydrocracking or breaking down by hydrogen. Catalytic hydrogenation of unsaturated oils consumes large amounts of hydrogen as to produce solid fat. The manufacturing of organic chemical products makes use of hydrogenation as well. Significant amounts of hydrogen are employed as rocket fuels, combined with fluor or oxygen, as well as a rocket propellant. In addition, hydrogen can be used as a fuel for internal combustion engines. Scientists look into hydrogen fuel cells as a possible way to provide power, conducting research on the use of hydrogen as the fuel of the future. For example, hydrogen can be converted to diesel fuel, natural gas, and bio-fuels. In theory, there would be no emissions of toxic chemicals and CO2.Regarding health effects, it should be noted that hydrogen is highly flammable. Explosion can be caused by a variety of reactions, and air/ gas mixtures are explosive. The substance can enter the human body through inhalation, and high concentrations of hydrogen create an oxygen-deficient environment. Persons who breathe such an atmosphere might experience a variety of symptoms, including unconsciousness, dizziness, ringing in the ears, headaches, vomiting, nausea, and depression of all senses. The skin of victims may become blue in color. Death may occur in some cases. The gas is not expected to lead to teratogenicity, embryotoxicity, mutagenicity, or mutagenicity. However, it may aggravate preexisting respiratory conditions if overexposure occurs. A dangerous concentration of hydrogen in the air is observed on loss of containment, and it happens very quickly. Oxygen deficient environments are a source of concern when it comes to animal life. Plant life is not adversely affected. Discovered by Henry Cavendish in 1776. "
2,Helium,He,4.0026,"Helium  is a non-toxic, tasteless, odorless, and colorless gas. Heading the noble group, it is an inert monoatomic gas, and its melting and boiling points are some of the lowest compared with other elements. Except in extreme conditions, helium exists as gas only. Helium is also the second most abundant and the lightest element, which is present in around 24 percent of the elemental mass. This makes over twelve times the combined mass of heavier elements. The abundance of helium is similar to this percentage in Jupiter and the Sun because of its high binding energy. Due to its binding energy, helium-4 is abundant, being the product of radioactive decay as well as nuclear fusion. Helium-4 accounts for most of the helium found in the universe. According to researchers, it was during the Big Bang when helium-4 was formed. The nuclear fusion of hydrogen which takes place in the stars accounts for the formation of new helium today. Most of the helium on earth is produced as a result of radioactive decay. Some helium is present in the atmosphere, but its isolation and the subsequent separation of air is not cost-effective. It is cheaper and easier to isolate helium from some natural gases. In the United States, the concentration of helium was found to be as high as 7 percent in natural gases. Liquefaction and separations techniques are used to isolate it from these natural gases. This is not usually done in laboratory conditions, and the gas is kept in cylinders under pressure so that it is available commercially. Helium has different applications, with mixtures of oxygen and helium being used as artificial air. It is also used for pressurizing liquid-fuel rockets and for filling balloons. Helium is heavier than hydrogen and safer to use in balloons because it does not burn. In the semi-conductor industry, the gas is used to create an inert atmosphere, which is suitable for growing germanium crystals and silicon. Helium is also employed in the production of zirconium and titanium because it is a high temperature gas. In gas chromatography, the element serves as a carrier gas. Liquid helium is used to generate superconductivity in some metals because of its low temperature. In addition, helium is employed in impulse facilities and supersonic wind tunnels because of its calorically and thermally perfect nature, heat capacity ratio, high speed of sound, and inertness. In arc welding, the element is used as a shielding gas for materials that are weakened and contaminated by nitrogen or air at welding temperatures. Some shelding gases, which are inert in nature, are employed in tungsten arc welding. For materials with high heat conductivity, such as copper and aluminum, helium is used instead of argon. Leak detection is another industrial application of the gas. Helium diffusion through solids takes 3 times faster than that of air, and it is thus used to detect leaks in high-temperature containers, cryogenic tanks, and other high-vacuum equipment. To test an object, it is put in a chamber and then filled with helium after being evacuated. Among its other uses, helium is used in rocketry. It serves as an ullage medium where oxidizers and fuel are displaced as to condense oxygen and hydrogen and produce rocket fuel. Prior to launch, helium is employed to purge oxidizer and fuel from the ground support equipment. "
3,Lithium,Li,6.939,"Lithium Lithium is the least dense and least heavy element of all the solid elements. It is highly flammable and reactive, which is why it is usually conserved in mineral oil (a type of paraffin). It is highly reactive with air and when it comes into contact with air, its metallic surface quickly changes to a dull gray, then blackish. This element never occurs freely in nature, of course, only as part of an ionic compound. Lithium is often obtained from clay and brine. It is also isolated synthetically from potassium and lithium chloride.  Lithium is a relatively unstable element because its stable isotopes have a very low binding energy level. This means they are not prone to fission, which is breaking down. This is why, lithium is less common in the galaxy than some other elements with a higher atomic weight. Lithium was used in a nuclear experiment predating the creation of the nuclear bomb by a long term. Its atoms were transformed to helium in 1932. Lithium is the least dense of all elements, which are not in gaseous form. The next lightest element, potassium, is almost twice as dense. Lithium, hydrogen, and helium are the least dense elements in a liquid or solid state. Regarding applications of the element, lithium and the compounds of lithium are used to make alloys for aircraft, batteries, in heat-resistant ceramics and glass, and other commercial applications. Lithium is also used in greases. Being a strong base, lithium hydroxide produces soap when heated with fat. It is made of lithium stearate and can thicken oils. Thus, lithium soap is used in the production of high-temperature, all-purpose greases. Lithium has other industrial and chemical uses as well. Lithium bromide and lithium chloride are employed as desiccants, which are hydroscopic substances that sustain or induce a state of dryness. Metallic lithium, Li[AlH4], and other of its complex hydrides are employed as high-energy additives to rocket propellants. In addition, lithium nitrate, lithium perchlorate, lithium chlorate, and lithium peroxide are used in oxygen candles and as oxidizers in rocket propellants. An important lithium compound, lithium hydroxide is obtained from another compound – lithium carbonate."
4,Beryllium,Be,9.0122,"Beryllium  (atomic number 4, symbol Be) is a divalent chemical metal which occurs in nature in a combination with different minerals and metals. It is found in the composition of some noble gemstones, including chrysoberyl and beryl. In a free state, beryllium is a lightweight, strong, brittle, and steel-grey, alkaline earth metal. This metal is mostly used to harden alloys and specifically beryllium copper. Due to its thermal stability, flexural rigidity, low density, and thermal conductivity, beryllium is used in structural applications, with its qualities making it an aerospace material. It is used for space vehicles, missiles, high speed aircraft, and communication satellites. Because of its atomic mass and low density, the metal is transparent of ionizing radiation such as X-rays. It is also widely used in experiments in particle physics and for X-ray equipment. Due to their high thermal conductivity, beryllium oxide and beryllium are used in heat sinking applications and heat transport. It should be noted that beryllium is a very toxic metal and exposure to it, which is above the threshold value, may result in berylliosis or acute beryllium disease. Toxic exposure occurs most often through inhalation. Different effects have been associated with beryllium. Combined with protein, beryllium can be deposited in the kidneys, spleen, and liver. In a combination with a biological protein, beryllium can case a chronic condition, associated with a hypersensitivity response of the immune system. The toxic effects of beryllium are mainly associated with the respiratory system - the alveoli and the lungs in general. Before the discovery of its toxic effects, beryllium was widely used is many industrial sectors. Today, strict regulations have been set in place as to protect the persons who work with and directly handle beryllium. Thanks to these regulations, the meal is relatively safe to work with and is employed in the production of various products. Beryllium was first discovered by the French chemist L.M. Vauquelin in 1798. While working with aluminum, he observed some white powder which did not resemble aluminum or the derivatives of aluminum. The chemist called it gluinium because it tasted sweet as glucose. It was not until 1828 when the German metallurgist Wohler managed to reduce the element to its metallic form, renaming it beryllium. Beryllium did not have commercial applications until the beryllium-aluminum alloy was patented by Cooper. After it was patented, Charles II became interested with the metal because of its nuclear cross section, high heat absorption, stiffness, and light weight. Several of its properties were found to be of significant value to today’s industry. Among these are its low density and high stiffness to weight ratio. In addition, beryllium has a very high melting point, low thermal expansion coefficient, and good electrical conductive and thermal properties. Moreover, alloys that contain beryllium are resistant to corrosion, and the addition of small amounts of the metal to alloys gives them a good resistance when it comes to metal fatigue. Beryllium is used to make mirrors, radiation windows, electronics, magnetic applications, nuclear applications, and more. It is also used for the production of high frequency speaker drivers because of its high rigidity and low weight. Finally, beryllium oxide is used in applications requiring the combination of two properties – those of heat conductor and electrical insulator. Beryllium oxide is often employed as an insulator in the production of radio frequency transmitters. "
5,Boron,B,10.811,"Boron  is a chemical element and a metalloid. Because stellar nucleosynthesis does not lead to the production of boron, it is only available in small amounts in the earth's crust and the solar system. Due to the water solubility of borate minerals, which are naturally occurring compounds of boron, the element is concentrated on Earth. Borate minerals are mined in the form of evaporate ores, including kernite and borax. The chemically uncombined form of boron does not occur naturally on Earth. Pure boron is not easily produced because it forms different refractory materials which contain other elements (e. g. small amounts of carbon). The chemical was discovered by the French chemists Louis-Jaques Thénard and Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac and independently by the English chemist Sir Humphry Davy. The three chemists isolated the element by combining potassium and boric acid. Today, it is produced in pure form by heating borax with carbon. If half-purity is required, other methods can be used as well. There are several compounds of boron that are of commercial importance. Sodium borate pentahydrate is the most important such compound. The manufacturing of sodium perborate bleach and fiberglass insulation require large amounts of sodium borate pentahydrate. Boric acid is another commercially important compound used in the production of cellulose insulation and textile fiberglass. Sodium borate decahydrate, known as borax, is also commercially important. It has applications as a mild antiseptic and in the manufacture of laundry products. Other compounds of boron are used to produce enamel for covering steel, borosilicate glasses, and as a potential medication to treat arthritis. Boron filaments are lightweight and high-strength materials used mainly as an element of composite materials for aerospace structures as well as for the manufacturing of sporting and consumer goods such as fishing rods and golf clubs. Vapor deposition of the element on a tungsten filament can be used to produce the fibers. Sodium perborate is used as the source of active oxygen in cleaning products, laundry detergents, detergents, and laundry bleaches. While it is called 'Borateem', the laundry bleach does not contain boron compounds any longer, and the bleaching agent contained is sodium percarbonate. Boric acid also has commercial importance and is used as an insecticide, especially against cockroaches, fleas, and ants. The chemical is also a dopant for germanium, silicon, silicon carbide, and other semiconductors. It donates a hole, and this results in p-type conductivity. Atomic diffusion is the method used to introduce the element into semiconductors, carried out at high temperatures. Gaseous, liquid, or solid boron sources can be used in the process.In flares and pyrotechnics, boron produces a green color, and it has been used as a source of ignition in some rockets. An isotope occurring in nature, boron-10 absorbs neutrons and is employed as a neutron detector, as a radiation shield, and in nuclear reactors for control rods.Chemically, boron has more similarities with silicon than with thallium, indium, gallium, and aluminum. It has a black color and is semi-metallic, available commercially. Crystalline boron exhibits chemical inertness.  Super-hard boron compounds include boron nitride, heterodiamand, and rhenium diboride, which has a hexagonal layered structure. The naturally occurring isotopes of boron are two while isotopes are 13 in number. 10B or enriched boron is used in boron neutron capture therapy and in radiation shielding. "
6,Carbon,C,12.01115,"Carbon  is a chemical element, which is tetravalent and nonmetallic. It is among the few elements that have been known to people since antiquity. Carbon has several allotropes, among which are amorphous carbon, diamond, and graphite. Depending on the allotropic form, carbon's physical properties can vary widely. Graphite, for instance, is black and opaque, while diamond is very transparent. Graphite is so soft that it can produce a streak on paper while diamond is one of the hardest materials. Graphite has good conductor properties, and diamond has poor electrical conductivity. At the same time, it has higher thermal conductivity than other materials under normal conditions. Graphite is mostly used as a lubricant and is a form of carbon. While it occurs naturally, graphite is also made when petroleum coke is treated in an oxygen-free oven. In nature, graphite is found in its alpha and beta forms. Their properties are identical, but the alpha and beta have different crystal structure. The graphite, which is produced commercially, is an alpha type. Apart from being used as a lubricant, graphite is used in the production of steel in large amounts when in the form of coke. Coke is produced when soft coal is heated in an oven, not allowing oxygen to mix with it. When used in pencils, the black material is often called lead, which is actually graphite. Amorphous carbon is produced by burning material which contains carbon without allowing oxygen to fully burn it. Lampblack, known as carbon black, channel black, and gas black is black soot. It is used to produce rubber, paints, and inks. Black soot can be made into shapes, forming the core of many dry cell batteries. Carbon is an element with key importance to all living systems and life, in its present form, would not exist without it. Carbon has commercial importance as well. It is used as hydrocarbons, particularly crude oil and fossil fuel methane, with crude oil being used to produce kerosene and gasoline through distillation. Cellulose is a carbon-containing, natural polymer that plants produce in the form of hemp, linen, and cotton. Some carbon polymers are commercially valuable and of animal origin, including cashmere, wool, and silk. Plastics are produced from polymers with synthetic carbon origin, oftentimes with nitrogen and oxygen atoms included in the major chain. For a variety of such synthetic resources, the raw material is crude oil. The uses of carbon compounds and carbon itself are quite varied. With iron, it forms alloys, of which carbon steel is the most common. In combination with clays, graphite forms the material to be used in pencils for drawing and writing. Carbon is also used as a molding material to manufacture glass, as a pigment, in electroforming and electroplating, in dry battery electrodes, and in brushes for electric motors. In addition, carbon is used in nuclear reactors as a neutron moderator. Charcoal is used for grilling, as a drawing material, for iron smelting, and a variety of other processes. Oil, coal, and wood are used as fuel when space heating and energy are produced. Industrial diamonds are employed in polishing, cutting, and drilling tools for machining stone and metals. Diamonds of gem quality are used to make jewelry pieces."
7,Nitrogen,N,14.0067,"Nitrogen  (atomic number 7, symbol N) is a tasteless, odorless, and colorless chemical element, which, by volume, constitutes 78.09 percent of the earth's atmosphere.  According to estimates, this element is 7th in abundance in the solar system and our galaxy. Scientists hypothesize that its occurrence is the result of a fusion reaction between hydrogen and carbon in supernovas. While nitrogen is a volatile element, its compounds occur commonly in the form of gases on Earth and in the atmospheres of moons and planets with atmospheres. A number of industrially important compounds contain nitrogen, including organic nitrates (e.g. explosives and propellants), nitric acid, ammonia, and cyanides. The element has a variety of applications and is used in the production of stainless steel and electronic parts such as integrated circuits, diodes, and transistors. Pressurized and dried, nitrogen is used for high-voltage equipment. As a modified atmosphere, it helps preserve the freshness of bulk and packaged foods.  The chemical is also used to reduce and concentrate the volume of samples in liquid form. The solvent evaporates and leaves the un-evaporated solvent and the salutes behind. Interestingly, nitrogen is used to pressure kegs for some types of beer such as British ales and stouts. Nitrogen-charged beers are packaged in bottles and cans with the use of a pressure-sensitive nitrogen capsule. A mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen is used to saturate beer with carbon dioxide. This element is mainly used for the production of ammonia. Ammonia is then used to make explosives, fertilizers, and nitric acid (through the Ostwald process). Oil companies extract crude oil through high pressure nitrogen. The element is also used for low-temperature scientific experimentation, preservation of biological samples, and refrigeration. The ability to fix or combine nitrogen is a main feature of industrial chemistry. The inorganic and organic salts of nitric acids store chemical energy. Among them are compounds such as ammonium nitrate and potassium nitrate. Ammonium nitrate is an important explosive and fertilizer while potassium nitrate, also known as saltpeter, is used in gunpowder. Other nitrate compounds, including nitrocellulose, trinitrotoluene, and nitroglycerin, are used as propellants and explosives in modern firearms. Hydrazine derivatives and hydrazine find use as monopropellants and rocket fuels. In many of these compounds, the tendency to explode and burn is due to the fact that nitrogen is present in the form of oxide and not as the more stable nitrogen molecule. The latter is formed as a product of the thermal decomposition of compounds. When nitrates explode or burn, they form a triple bond, thus producing energy. Human activity has changed the natural supply of nitrites and nitrates. The extensive use of fertilizers is the main reason for the addition of nitrites and nitrates. They are used as food conservatives and form during chemical production. This causes surface water and groundwater nitrogen concentration, and the level of nitrogen in food increases greatly. Nitrogen bonds affect the environment by changing the composition of certain species.  Nitrates also have health effects on animals and humans. Foods with high level of nitrogen compounds decrease the amount of oxygen transported through blood, which has serious consequences for cattle. High nitrogen uptake leads to vitamin A deficiency and causes problems in the thyroid gland. In the intestines and stomach of animals, nitrates form dangerous carcinogenic compounds. "
8,Oxygen,O,15.9994,"Oxygen Oxygen (atomic number 8, symbol O) is among the most abundant elements and 9 known isotopes. Air is made of 21% oxygen and 78% nitrogen. Silicon-oxygen minerals make most of the Earth's crust. Oxygen has cubic lattice structure and is paramagnetic in solid and liquid state. It is an odorless gas with a light blue color, which is soluble in water. Oxygen is a gas and a non-metal. Non-metals are found in two states at room temperature - solids such as selenium and phosphorus and gases (e.g. nitrogen and oxygen). The element has 2 allotropes - ozone and diatomic form. Ozone has 3 atoms while the diatomic form has 2 unpaired electrons. Oxygen has 3 oxidation states: +2, -2, and -1 and is present in calcium oxide and other solid oxides. Oxygen has many commercial and scientific applications. It is used to remove carbon and sulfur from iron ore. In the chemical industry, it is used to create a large variety of products, including some types of polymers and antifreeze. The main applications of oxygen are in the manufacturing of chemicals and glass and stone products. Oxygen is also used for rocket propulsion and life support. Submariners and scuba divers rely on a mixture of air and oxygen while pure oxygen is commonly used for emergency treatment. Given that oxygen is a highly reactive element, most chemicals form compounds with it. Inert gases are the only exception. It is found in many organic compounds, in minerals and rocks, and in water. It combines with metals and non-metals and forms oxides. Oxides include those of phosphorus, aluminum, and sulfur. It also forms salt-like compounds and basic compounds such as aluminates and silicates. These compounds are solid and are not used to separate oxygen because it is very expensive. The methods of production depend on the quantity that has to be produced. Thermal decomposition is one method. Decomposition of potassium nitrate or potassium chlorate is another way to produce oxygen. Catalysts such as manganese dioxide are also used in the decomposition of potassium chlorate. Electrolysis of water and decomposition of hydrogen peroxide and oxides of heavy metals are other methods.  Common oxygen compounds include silica, water, and different iron oxides. Other compounds include bauxite or aluminum oxide, gypsum or calcium sulphate, and marble or calcium carbonate. Different types of organic compounds, including ketones, ethers, and alcohols, contain oxygen. Ketones are synthesized by ozonolysis, hydration of alkynes, hydrolysis of salts, and geminal halide hydrolysis. They have different industrial applications and are used as pharmaceuticals and solvents. Ethers also contain oxygen and are synthesized through synthesis, dehydration, Ullmann condensation, and other methods. Dimethyl ether is an aerosol spray propellant while diethyl ether is used as a starting fluid, anesthetic, and boiling solvent. Other compounds that contain oxygen include amides, acid anhydrides, and carboxylic acids. In addition, a number of organic solvents, including furan, formic acid, and methanol contain oxygen. Most biomolecules contain oxygen, except for carotenes and squalene. All protein molecules contain oxygen, but carbohydrates have the largest percentage by mass. The element is also present in the bones in the form of hydroxylapatite and calcium phosphate. It occurs in the pyrimidines (heterocyclic compounds) of DNA and RNA as well. "
9,Fluorine,F,18.9984,"Fluorine . They are found in all three states of matter at standard temperatures and are unique in that sense. Fluorine has one isotope, fluorine-19. The others are unstable. Fluorine is a very strong oxidizing agent because it attracts the highest number of electrons of all elements except chlorine. The compounds formed by this element with all other elements, except neon and helium, are called fluorides. Albeit much weaker than hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid is extremely corrosive. The compounds include metal fluorides, organic compounds with fluorine, and more. The former are usually ionic salts that are most often soluble in water. Organic fluorine compounds are usually very stable both chemically and thermally. They are water-repellent and have relatively low melting and boiling points. Some of these are widely used, like hydrofluorocarbon gases used in freezing or Teflon. As it is highly reactive, fluorine is not found on its own in nature. The name of the element comes from the Latin verb fluo, which means 'flow'. This is because fluorite lowered the melting points of certain metal ores when added to them. Prior to 1886, fluorine was known only as a mineral. That year, it was derived as an element on its own by the French chemist Henri Moissan, famous for discovering the electrolysis method in industrial production. Commercially the element is applied in toothpaste because it is known to help prevent tooth decay. Some compounds of the element, as well as the element on its own, are dangerously toxic. However, this has not deterred pharmaceutical companies from adding it to their products. Around 10 percent of all newly produced drugs contain fluorine as well.City water supplies also contain fluoride (the proportion is 1 part per 1 million) with the aim of preventing tooth decay. Other compounds of fluoride are also added to toothpastes, including sodium monofluorophosphate, stannous (II) fluoride, and sodium fluoride. Again, preventing tooth decay is sought. Hydrofluoric acid is employed to etch glass, including glass that is used in light bulbs. Uranium hexafluoride is used for the separation of uranium isotopes. Crystals of calcium fluoride, called fluorspar and fluorite, are used to produce lenses focusing infrared light. Some compounds, for example, dichlorodifluoromethane were commonly used in refrigeration systems and air conditioning, as well as in aerosol spray cans. However, they were found to damage the ozone layer of the Earth and phased out. Finally, with carbon, fluorine forms compounds, which are known as fluorocarbons.Atoms of fluorine contain nine protons and nine electrons. The external electrons have a nuclear charge of +7. The element tends to gain an electron, being the most electronegative element of all. It takes an immense amount of energy to remove an electron from a fluorine atom. The minerals fluorite, fluorapatite, and cryolite are the most abundant ones containing fluorine that have some industrial use. "
10,Neon,Ne,20.183,"Neon  (atomic number 10, symbol Ne) is a chemical element and an inert noble gas, which gives a red-orange glow to neon advertising signs, low-voltage glow lamps, and high-voltage discharge tubes. This element is the 2nd lightest noble gas, with the narrowest liquid range of all elements. It has 3 times the refrigerating capacity of liquid hydrogen and 40 times that of liquid helium. Neon is a less expensive refrigerant compared to helium. Two types of lighting are made neon glow lamps and signs. Neon lamps are used in circuit-testing equipment and as power-on indicators. Today, LEDs or light-emitting diodes dominate in most applications. Simple neon devices are the forerunners of plasma TV screens and plasma displays. Compared to lamps, neon signs operate at a higher voltage, and the tubing is formed into letters and shapes for signage as well as artistic and architectural applications. Neon is also used in lightning arrestors, high-voltage indicators, vacuum tubes, and helium-neon lasers. Both liquid neon and neon gas are relatively expensive. The rarity of the element explains the high price as it can be obtained from air only. The boiling point of neon is -246 °C, and the melting point -249 °C. Its ionic radius and electronegativity according to Pauling are unknown. The element is created by the fusion of oxygen and helium in the alpha process, which requires masses over three solar masses and temperatures above 100 megakelvins. By mass, neon is the 5th most abundant element after carbon, oxygen, helium, and hydrogen. While it is abundant in the universe, neon is a rare element on earth due to its chemical inertness, high vapor pressure at low temperature, and relative lightness. These properties keep the element from being trapped in dust clouds and condensing gas, which resulted in the formation of warmer and smaller planets like Earth. Neon has 3 stable isotopes – Ne-20, Ne-21, and Ne-22, with Ne-22 and Ne-21 being partly nucleogenic and partly primordial. The main primordial isotope, Ne-20 is known to be radiogenic or nucleogenic. Ne-20 is stable with 10 neutrons and Ne-21 – with 11 neutrons. Elevated Ne-20 abundances have been found in diamonds, and this suggests that there is a solar neon reservoir on the planet. Scientists have analyzed exposed terrestrial rocks and demonstrated the cosmic ray or cosmogenic production of Ne-31. It is formed by spallation reactions with aluminum, silicon, sodium, and magnesium. The cosmogenic element can be resolved from nucleogenic neon or magmatic neon. This suggests that neon can be used to determine the cosmic exposure ages of meteorites and surface rocks. Neon can enter the body through inhalation and may cause suffocation if present in a confined area. Excessive concentrations can result in loss of consciousness, vomiting, nausea, dizziness, and death. Death often results from loss of consciousness, confusion, and errors in judgment that prevent self-rescue. Death and unconsciousness may occur in seconds at low oxygen concentrations. The first symptoms are air hunger and rapid respirations. Muscular coordination is impaired and alertness is diminished. Later, all sensations are depressed and judgment becomes faulty. As asphyxia progresses, this leads to vomiting and nausea, prostration, convulsions, and deep coma. This element is a chemically inert and non-toxic rare atmospheric gas. It forms no compounds and is chemically unreactive, which means that it has no impact on the environment. "
11,Sodium,Na,22.9898,"Sodium  (atomic number 11, symbol Na) is a metal and a chemical element that was discovered in 1807 by the Cornish inventor and chemist Humphry Davy. It occurs in sodium salts and minerals, including rock salt, sodalite, and feldspars. This metal has a relatively low melting point and is reactive and soft. It is a good electrical conductor with a silvery color. There are three isotopes and different compounds such as carbonates, nitrates, sulfates, and halides. Sodium also forms organosodium compounds, solides, and electrides. The element reacts with metallic halides, hydrogen, ammonia, and water. When reacting with ice, snow, and water, it forms hydrogen and sodium hydroxide. There are different commercial applications, but it is mostly used to produce triphenylphosphine, indigo, and sodium azide and borohydride. Azide, for example, is used for inorganic and organic synthesis and to produce airplane escape chutes and car airbags. It is also a biocide and preservative and inhibits the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. The element is also added to alloys and used to process molten metals and to descal metals. It is also used to produce sodium vapor lamps and soaps. Sodium carbonate, for example, is an additive that is used as a stabilizer and raising and anti-caking agent. It has other applications as well and is used in the cotton and brick industries. Sodium carbonate is used to treat cottonseed, extrude clay, and form compounds such as zinc, aluminum, and iron(II) carbonate. The element itself is used for different tests such as the sodium fusion test and Birch reduction, which was reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch. Sodium carbonate is used to purify water while its hydroxide reduces clogging. One of its compounds, hydrogen carbonate is used to produce cleansers and soaps and in the leather and clothing industries. Sodium is found in nature in the form of salts such as sodium sulfate, nitrate, borate, carbonate, and chloride. It is found in spring water, alkaline and salty lakes, and seawater. Sodium is also important for proper nutrition and good muscle and nerve functioning. However, excessive sodium intake can cause hypertension and kidney problems. Foods with a high sodium content include bacon, salad dressings, pickles, cheese, salted nuts, and instant soups. Sodium deficiency, on the other hand, leads to muscle cramps and spasms, cognitive impairment, confusion, fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, and others. Sodium is also important for plants and other species. It plays a role in chlorophyll synthesis and metabolism. There are health hazards as well. When sodium reacts with water, fumes are formed that can cause throat, nose, eye, and skin irritation. Coughing and sneezing are other side effects. Elemental sodium must be handled with care because it forms a hydroxide which is caustic. It reacts with oxides, acidic oxides, and acids. At the same time sodium hydroxide has many commercial applications and is used in cleaning solutions, the food industry, and chemical pulping. Interestingly, it is also used for chemical peeling of vegetables and fruits, in cocoa processing and chocolate production, thickening of ice cream, production of soft drinks and colorings, as well as poultry scalding. As a cleaning agent, it is used to remove protein-based and fat deposits as well as oil and grease stains. The Chinese noodles and German pretzels also contain small amounts. In the past, the compound was used to identify whether carbon monoxide poisoning has occurred. Other methods are used today, including CO-oximeters. While sodium is important for health and has many applications, long-term exposure can lead to chemical bronchitis, difficulty breeding, caustic and thermal burns, tingling, and itching. These side effects occur as a result of overexposure. Permanent damages occur in severe cases. In a powdered form, sodium is toxic in combination with other substances. It is an environmental hazard when released in water bodies."
12,Magnesium,Mg,24.312,"Magnesium    Magnesium is found in significant quantities in different minerals, such as serpentine, olivine, magnetite, dolomite, and others. It is the 3rd most abundant element in the earth’s crust, after iron and aluminum, and is also found is salty layers, underground brines, and seawater. The major world supplier of magnesium is the US, supplying about 45 percent of it globally. Magnesite and dolomite are mined, with quantities reaching 10 million tonnes annually, in countries such as Greece, Russia, Austria, Slovakia, North Korea, Turkey, and China. Mg is generated mainly by obtaining magnesium salts from brine and undergoing electrolysis. Magnesium does not occur naturally as a free element, being extremely reactive. As a free metal, it burns with a bright white light. Its reactivity is partly concealed because it is covered with a layer of oxide following production. The compounds of this element usually have the appearance of white crystals. A great deal of them is soluble in water. Mg has three stable isotopes - 24Mg, 25Mg, and 26Mg. The majority of magnesium is in the form of the first isotope. The element is light and silvery-white in color. Its strong reaction with water makes it useful in that it can power a magnesium-based engine. It also reacts with hydrochloric acid and other acids. There is a subsequent release of hydrogen gas. Mg is extremely flammable, but not in large quantities. If it starts to burn though, it is very hard to put out. This is because it can burn in nitrogen, water, and carbon dioxide, forming different chemical compounds with all of these. The only way to deal with a magnesium fire is to smother it under dry sand to break off all contact with the atmosphere. In the early years of photography, magnesium was used as a source of light. This was because of the brilliant light it gives off when burning in air. Today, the element is used to produce fireworks and marine flares. It reaches very high temperatures when burning, up to 3,100 °C. The main use of this element is in aluminum-magnesium alloys. The element is commonly used in fertilizers, laxatives, for nerve stabilization, and the treatment of spasms of blood vessels (as an element in certain types of medications).    The element is sour, making it useful to improve the taste of mineral water in low amounts. It makes up a large part of the human body as well, with vital ions. Magnesium plays a vital role in the formation of DNA too. Humans need at least 200 mg of magnesium and can take up to 350 mg a day. The human body deals quite efficiently with magnesium – it recycles excessive amounts and takes it from food whenever contained in it. Persistent intake of high amounts, however, may result in confusion, lethargy, and muscle weakness. "
13,Aluminum,Al,26.9815,"Aluminum  has the atomic number of 13. This silvery white element is a member of the boron group. It is the most abundant element in the world after oxygen and silicon and the most abundantly present in the Earth's crust. It makes up approximately 8 percent of the solid surface of the Earth. This element is extremely reactive with almost all chemicals, elements, and compounds and is not found in nature. However, it is part of more than 270 different minerals. Its low density and non-corrosive properties make it a vital structural component in the aerospace industry and other sectors. Its most useful compounds are oxides and sulfates. Oxides are found in the oxidation state of ?2. They can be chemical compounds formally containing oxygen in this state. Oxides are formed when elements come into contact with the oxygen in the air, meaning that they are oxidized. Most of the Earth's crust consists of oxides. Sulfates, on the other hand, are salts of sulfuric acids and are also very prevalent in the environment. Despite the abundance of aluminum salts in nature, they are not used by any life form. Plants and animals exist in perfect balance with them. Aluminum has different compounds, including oxide and hydroxides, halides, nitride, carbide, and related metals. Organoaluminum compounds fall into this group as well and are commonly employed in industrial chemistry. Because of the variety of aluminum’s combinations of properties, its uses are quite diverse. This element is employed in different domains, including commerce, industry, transport, and more. The uses of aluminum are not always obvious. Aluminum oxide, for example, is used in the production of glass. The element is used in the transport industry as well because it is lightweight. Due to this property, less energy has to be expended to move vehicles made of aluminum. Being lightweight is especially important when it comes to the manufacturing of planes. Notably, aluminum is a soft, light, malleable yet extremely durable element. It is sometimes soluble in water, but not in alcohol. It is around one-third as dense as steel. It is easily processed, cast, and drawn. The reason it does not rust is because a thin surface layer of aluminum oxide forms when aluminum comes into contact with air. This puts a stop to the oxidation process. Aluminum is often used in silver-colored paint because it sustains silvery reflectance in a powdered form. In fact, aluminum finish is characterized by the highest reflectance of all metals in UV and far IR regions. In the visible specter, it comes in third after tin and silver. The element functions very well as a conductor of heat and electricity, because it has 59 percent of the heat and electricity conductivity of copper. It can function well as a superconductor because its critical temperature in this regard is 1.2 Kelvin. Stable aluminum is formed by means of a fusion between hydrogen and magnesium. This happens in big stars or supernovae. The element is 100 percent recyclable, and none of its qualities are lost. When it is recycled, the scrap is melted. This takes just 5 percent of the energy used to produce aluminum from ore. On the downside, as much as 15 percent of the input material is lost this way. Aluminum can be derived from the ensuing waste product as well."
14,Silicon,Si,28.086,"Silicon This is a brittle, electropositive element with a boiling point of 3265 C (5909 F). Silicon has two known allotropes –crystalline and amorphous with relatively high boiling and melting points. It is lustrous and gray in color. Common oxidation states are -4, -3, -2, -1, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Silicon forms a number of compounds, including silatranes, tetrahalides, disilenes, silane, and others. Si-30, Si-29, and Si-28 are stable isotopes. The isotopes are 5 in total. Silicon forms when crystals are doped with arsenic, phosphorus, germanium, gallium, and potassium. The Czochralski process is used to grow crystals. The major producers are the United States, Russia, and China. Pure silicon occurs in different minerals, including opal, jasper, rock crystal, agate amethyst, and quartz while amorphous opaline or biogenic silica can be found in siliceous sponges and diatoms. Silicates and silica are abundant and non-toxic. Minerals are also mined, including kaolinite, perlite, vermiculite, and olivine. Some types of silica are rare and expensive. Examples include microcrystallines and diamond stimulants such as rhinestone, agate, gemstone opal, and others. Silicon has application in electronics and alloys in the steel industry. It is added to alloys to reduce cracks and tearing.  The element is also used to produce semiconductor devices and detectors, photovoltaic applications, and wafers. Its compounds also have commercial applications. Sodium silicate, for example, is used as an egg preservative and added to adhesives and soaps. It is also added to silicon which is used for implants, insulators, polishing agents, and lubricants. Silicon has many applications in the food and chemical industries. For example, silicon oils are added to different foods and beverages because of their chemical inertness, thermal stability, and water insolubility. Lubricating oils and antifoaming agents are used in food processing and production.  Silicon dioxide is used to produce microelements, structured materials, defoamer components, and aerogels. In addition, silica is a fining agent which is added to juices, beer, and wine.   Silicon is found in the skin and connective tissue. It is non-toxic but may cause respiratory problems. Some of its compounds, for example, silicon dioxide are considered a health hazard. It is found in aerogels, silica gels, fumed silica, and fused quartz. Long-term exposure to cristobalite and quartz increases the risk for lung cancer. Refractory brick workers, pottery and granite workers, and miners are also at risk. Overexposure can lead to chronic conditions and autoimmune disorders, including sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and scleroderma. Long-term exposure to silica also leads to fungal and bacterial infections and renal diseases. Inhalation increases the risk for emphysema, obstructive pulmonary disease, and bronchitis. These effects are more common in tobacco users and smokers. Skin inflammations have been reported as well, including side effects such as itching, scaling, and reddening. In general, side effects are uncommon when exposure is kept within normal limits. "
15,Phosphorus,P,30.9738,"Phosphorus Phosphorus (atomic number 15, symbol P) is a non-metal with a monoclinic structure and 3 main allotropes - black, red, and white. It has 3 oxidation states - 5, 4, 3 and is a multivalent non-mental. The element occurs in the form of phosphates, as organophosphates, and in minerals. Because it is highly reactive, white phosphorus should be stored under water, meaning that the element does not occur freely in nature. It is reactive, soft, poisonous, and explosive. Black phosphorus has few commercial applications and is used to make anodes for lithium-ion batteries. It does not ignite easily and is less reactive than the other two. It is a good conductor of electricity and is black in color. Red phosphorus is formed when white phosphorus is exposed to light or when heated, making it amorphous. The allotrope has polymeric structure and is used in the production of safety matches. Phosphorus was discovered in 1669 by Hennig Brand, an alchemist and physician of German origin. He processed, filtered, and boiled a large amount of urine to isolate the element. Because phosphorus was used in nerve agents, poisons, and explosives, it is also known as the Devil’s element. It has different commercial applications and is used for smoke-screening, production of incendiary and smoke bombs, as well as tracer ammunition. One of the phosphorus compounds, phosphoric acid is used to make a variety of phosphate compounds and soft drinks. Water softeners and cleaning agents are made by using another compound, trisodium phosphate. Calcium phosphate is used to produce baking powder and to manufacture china. Some compounds of phosphorus absorb radiation and emit light and are used in the production of television sets and light bulbs. Inorganic phosphorus plays role in RNA and DNA. Phosphate is used by the cells to transport adenosine triphosphate, which is a form of cellular energy. All processes at the cellular level require adenosine triphosphate. A small percentage of phosphate can be found in the human blood while phosphorus is present in the teeth, bones, extracellular fluids, and soft tissues. The main sources of phosphorus are foods that contain protein such as meats, dairy products, and breads. Meats that are rich in phosphorus include fried and breaded scallops, crab, catfish, lamb, and others. Among the dairy products with a high amount of phosphorus are Swiss cheese, Ricotta cheese, instant chocolate pudding, and milkshakes. The amount present in different products varies. Vegetable oils are low in phosphorus while liver contains high amounts. Apatite, including hydroxylapatite and fluorapatite, is a group of phosphate minerals. The major mining sites are found in Tunisia, the United States, Morocco, and Russia. Depletion of the phosphorus deposits is a source of concern because food production is dependent on it, especially in the form of fertilizers. Large amounts of phosphate can cause a variety of health problems, including osteoporosis and kidney damage. White phosphorus is a very toxic allotrope and exposure can be fatal. Ingestion can cause drowsiness, stomach cramps, and nausea. In addition, it can cause kidney, heart, and liver damage, as well as skin burns. The element does not accumulate in aquatic plants and species because it does not react with other elements quickly. It remains in soil for a couple of days and then is transformed into other substances. At the bottom of lakes and rivers and in deep soils, the element may remain for hundreds and thousands of years. "
16,Sulphur,S,32.064,"Sulphur  (atomic number 16, symbol S) is a non-metal and element that is odorless and tasteless. It is known since ancient times and used in Egypt, China, and Greece. Sulfur reacts as an oxidant with non-metals and metals and as a reducing agent with fluorine, oxygen, and other elements. It forms different compounds, including organic compounds, metal sulfides, halides, oxides, and others. In fact, it combines with most elements from the Periodic Table. The element is bright yellow in color, soft, and abundant. Its boiling point is 445 C (833 F), and its melting point is 113 °C (235.4 °F). Sulfur has 28 isotopes and 30 allotropes. Four of its isotopes, S-36, S-34, S-33, and S-32 are stable. Deposits are found in Poland, Japan, Chile, and Indonesia. The main producers during the early 21st century were Japan, Germany, Canada, and China. Sulfur occurs in regions with volcanic activity and near hot springs. It can be found in different sulfides, including rosalgar, blende, galena, calcopyrite, and pyrite. Volcanic gases and sulfuric waters contain compounds such as hydrogen sulfide and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur and its compounds are also found in natural gas, petroleum, and coal ores as well as in the form of barium sulfate and calcium sulfate dehydrate. Salt domes in the Gulf of Mexico and swamplands in Louisiana, US also contain sulfur. The Frasch Process is one method that is used for extraction. Water is heated to melt deposits and extract water mixed with sulfur. The element is also obtained as a byproduct of oil extraction and refining. It is also recovered when nickel, cadmium, copper, zinc, lead, and other metals are processed. Sulfur trioxide is converted to sulfuric acid which comes in different concentrations. Sulfur has many applications and is used to produce fertilizers, insecticides, fungicides, and matches. It is also used in fireworks, gun powder, detergents, and matches. The element also has applications in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries and is used to produce solvents, fine chemicals, and concrete.  Sulfuric acid is an acid with many applications and is used as an electrolyte, cleaning agent, and catalyst. It is also added to drain cleaners that remove tissue paper, hair, grease, and dirt. Sulfuric acid is also added to medications that treat mouth ulcers and sores. The element is used to produce explosives, sheet metal, petroleum products, and fibers. It is also used in the production of dyestuffs, paper, detergents, pigments, and other products. Its compounds are added to lubricants and used to manufacture esters, inorganic salts, medications, and dyes. Some compounds are also used to produce rayon and rubber, solvents, as well as dermatological agents and sulfa drugs. Essential amino acids such as cysteine and methionine contain sulfur. Amino acids such as taurine and cysteine are components of coenzymes, enzymes, and hormones. Taurine, for example, is important for the proper functioning of the central nervous system, skeletal muscles, and cardiovascular system. Cysteine is another amino acid that contains sulfur and is found in the composition of proteins as well as plant and animal food sources. Some foods also contain sulfur, for example, foods that are rich in protein, including eggs, legumes, meat, poultry, fish, and nuts. Vegetables such as bok choy, turnips, Brussels sprouts, kale, cabbage, and broccoli are also good sources. Sulfur bonds, however, are a health hazard and cause respiratory problems, lung embolism, hearing defects, kidney and liver damage, and gastrointestinal problems. Exposure also leads to heart damage, poor blood circulation, behavioral changes, and compromised immunity. Hydrogen sulfide is a poisonous gas that is known as sour damp and swamp gas. It is colorless and heavy and is used as a reducing agent and bleach. In animals, exposure can lead to nervous system damage, brain damage, and other problems and disorders. "
17,Chlorine,Cl,35.453,"Chlorine  is a halogen element, poisonous greenish-yellow gas. Occurs widely in nature as sodium chloride in seawater, but it can be very dangerous depending on how it is used. It is most frequently found as chloride, as in sodium chloride, another name for your everyday table salt. The chloride ion itself is part of the salt in the earth and in the oceans. In fact, almost 2 percent of the seawater mass is made of chloride ions, and even more than that in the Dead Sea, which we all know is extremely salty. With close to 34 percent of salinity, Dead Sea is among the saltiest water bodies. Discovered by Karl Scheele in 1774. Humphrey David confirmed it as an element in 1810.Since chloride is generally soluble in water, large quantities of substances that contain chloride are usually only found in dry climates or deep under the ground, like in the Earth's crust. Chlorine is present in very high concentrations there. It is mostly found in minerals like halite, sylvite, and carnallite. Chlorine has many isotopes, the main ones being 35Cl (75.77 percent) and 37Cl (24.23 percent). They form the atomic weight of the element, which is 35.4527 g/mol. Chlorine has a very important scientific function – it is useful for geologic dating because of its half-life of 308,000 years. This means twice as many years have to pass before traces of it in the environment are lost. It can also be used to date waters less than 50 years before the present. It has been used to date ice and sediments as well. The amylase enzyme contains a chloride ion, while calcium chloride, a compound of chlorine, is used to reduce dampness in rooms. To this purpose, it is produced in pellet form. Calcium chloride has other applications, being used for sanite fortifying roadbases and to maintain unpaved roads. Chlorine is widely used in industry and household products. It can be very dangerous sometimes, especially when it is in the form of gas. In order to transport the chlorine gas, it must be pressurized and converted into liquid form, and when the liquid is released, it turns into a gas, which spreads very quickly. It has a pungent, unpleasant smell, like that of bleach. This smell can be an advantage because it can alert people to the presence of the gas. Another warning sign that the gas is present is its greenish-yellow color. Chlorine forms explosive compounds with some chemicals, but it is not flammable in itself. The gas was used during the First World War as a weapon to induce choking. Today, it is used in pesticides, rubber, solvents, and in swimming pool water against bacteria (that is why, your eyes sting, and it is mandatory to wear goggles almost everywhere). It is also used for sanitation purposes, like in garbage processing. Keep in mind that your everyday chlorine bleach, if mixed with other chemicals for cleaning, can transform into a chlorine gas. Practice caution when you are using it for whatever reason. Finally, chlorides are used in the petroleum industry. They are a component of the mud system and are closely monitored. When the amount of chlorides increases in the mud system, this can be a signal that drilling into salt-water formations, characterized with high pressure, is possible. The increase of chlorides, however, can also signal that the target sand is of poor quality.  "
18,Argon,Ar,39.948,"Argon  (Ar, atomic number 18) is the third most common gas in the world, even more so than carbon dioxide. The word 'argon' means inactive, inert in Greek and refers to this gas in that it reacts with very few other elements in the periodic table. It has eight electrons in the outer shell, which make it very stable and resistant to reactions. Argon is an odorless and colorless gas, found in the atmosphere to a small extent. It does not form chemical compounds and is heavier than air. Argon was isolated by Sir William Ramsay and Lord Rayleigh in Scotland in 1894. They had come to the conclusion that there was another gas in the air apart from nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide because the nitrogen they got from chemical compounds was slightly lighter than nitrogen from the atmosphere. They conducted an experiment, removing all of the carbon dioxide, oxygen, water, and nitrogen from an air sample. Argon was the first noble gas that was discovered. Until 1957 its symbol was A.Argon is produced by distilling liquid air. Liquid air is air, the temperature of which has been reduced to below freezing point, so it is condensed to a bluish moving liquid. The most common use for argon is as a shield in high-temperature industrial processes. It is very useful in this way because its inertia guarantees it will protect the welder or whatever the respective job in a high-temperature environment is. Argon keeps graphite from burning, which is why it is also used in graphite electric furnaces. It is also employed in incandescent and fluorescent lighting. Argon is used whenever an inert gas is required, being a cheap alternative to nitrogen. When nitrogen is not inert enough, argon comes as its cheapest alternative. The element is also used when low thermal conductivity is sought as well as when electronic properties (e.g. emission spectrum or ionization) are required. While other noble gasses may serve the same purpose, this one is the cheapest to use. Argon is a byproduct from the production of both nitrogen and oxygen, whereby a cryogenic air separation device is used. Both substances have a large-scale industrial use. In addition, in its liquid form, the element has been employed in dark matter searches. Argon is the noble gas making for a good atmosphere when air-sensitive materials are used.  It is the most suitable as a shield and protection mechanism. It has a variety of other uses being the byproduct of liquid oxygen and liquid nitrogen, produced through air separation. Both liquid nitrogen and liquid oxygen are used on a large scale. Every other noble gas is produced this way too, with the exception of helium, but argon is the most viable because it is most abundant in the atmosphere. Argon is also used in the processing of reactive elements, such as titanium, and in gas metal arc welding and gas tungsten arc welding. Nitrogen and oxygen must be excluded from these processes because they tend to damage the material. Argon is also used in the poultry industry for mass culling due to outbreaks of infections and diseases or as a more humane slaughter tool. In addition, argon is used to put out fires and avoid incurring damage to equipment."
19,Potassium,K,39.0983,"Potassium Potassium (atomic number 19, symbol K) is a metal and an important element in our diet. It is silvery-white in color, waxy, and soft. Potassium is a very reactive metal and one of the least dense metals in the periodic table. It has a body-centered cubic crystal structure and 1 oxidation state. The element oxidizes and tarnishes quickly when exposed to air. Potassium was first discovered in 1807 by Humphry Davy. It does not occur freely in nature and can be extracted from minerals such as polyhalite and sylvite. Potassium hydroxide, known as potash lye and caustic potash, is another source of potassium. Potash is mined in the United States (Utah and New Mexico), Germany, Israel, and other countries. Canada has large underground deposits of potash, found in the province of Saskatchewan. Potassium is a very reactive element and produces hydrogen gas and potassium hydroxide when reacting with water. It is formed by mixing calcium hydroxide and potassium carbonate (K2CO3) and the solution brought to boil.The element has 24 isotopes, but only potassium-39, potassium-40, and potassium 41 occur in nature. Potassium-40 decays to argon-40 and is used to date rocks. The element itself is used as a fertilizer in agriculture. Respiratory equipment is made using potassium superoxide while potassium chloride is used to make injections and medical drips. Potassium carbonate has application in the production of pigments, fluorescent lamps, and glass. Magnetometers are also made by using metallic potassium. They have application in oil and coal exploration and in archeology. The salts of potassium are used for leather tanning and in photography and baking. Potassium hydroxide has application in the production of liquid detergents, drain cleaners, and soaps. It has other industrial applications and is used in the manufacture of biodiesel and for refining of natural gas and petroleum. Potassium chloride, which is made of chlorine and potassium, is used in the lethal injection for prisoners on the death row in the U.S. It also has application in food processing and medicine. Potassium should be handled with extreme caution because of its reactive nature. Inhalation of mists or dust results in sore throat and nose, eye, and throat irritation. When ingested, it can cause hyperkalemia, which increases the risk for abnormal heart rhythm and cardiovascular problems. Potassium deficiency, on the other hand, leads to abdominal bloating, muscle weakness, dizziness, and heart palpitations. In extreme cases, hypokalemia can cause paralysis. In plants, potassium deficiency leads to low quality produce and low yields. High levels of potassium also affect plant growth by preventing the uptake of important minerals. Potassium bromate, which comes in the form of white powder or crystals, is used to enhance dough strength. Potassium bisulfite is used to make alcoholic beverages and as a food preservative. Potassium is important for human health. Some of its compounds are used in the food industry, including potassium bisulfite and potassium bromate. Foods that contain potassium include pistachios, raisins, fish such as tuna and salmon, and seeds. However, patients with kidney problems should limit the consumption of foods high in potassium because it can have life-threatening side effects. These include numbness, irregular palpitations and heartbeat and death in extreme cases. Patients who suffer from renal failure should also avoid potassium-rich foods because they can cause cardiac arrhythmia and heart problems. "
20,Calcium,Ca,40.08,"Calcium  is an alkaline earth metal and one of the most abundant elements found in the Earth's crust in terms of mass. This soft gray element is rather hard, and it is important for life on earth, especially for cell physiology whereby the calcium ion Ca2+ moves out and into the cytoplasm, signaling different cellular processes. It is the main component in the mineralization of shells and bones, and the most abundant element of all by mass in many living organisms. Calcium is an important constituent of teeth, leaves, and bones, and calcium carbonate is found in stalactites and stalagmites.  It makes up some 3.22 percent of the oceans, air, and earth. There are different natural forms of the metal, including gypsum, limestone, and fluorite. Apatite is a chlorophosphate or fluorophosphate of the element. In the 1st century, the Romans produced calx, which is lime, but it was only in 1808 when calcium was discovered. Pontin and Berzelius electrolyzed lime in mercury as to prepare calcium amalgam. Impure material was isolated by Davy. Nowadays, electrolysis of CaCl2 is used to prepare the metal, the temperature being just above its melting point. Calcium has a boiling point at 1484°C, melting point at 839°C, and a valance of 2. It forms different compounds such as calcium chloride, calcium hypochorite, calcium cyanamide, calcium sulfide, and others. One of calcium’s common compounds is calcium carbonate, which forms quicklime when heated and added to water. Slaked lime is thus formed, which represents an inexpensive material with application in the chemical industry. Limestone, marble, and chalk are different forms of this compound. Slaked lime or calcium hydroxide is produced when limestone is heated at temperature above 825 °C, water being added carefully to it. It is used in a variety of chemical refinery processes. Mixing sand and lime produces mortar, which is then made into plaster through the uptake of carbon dioxide. Mixing lime with different compounds makes a main component of Portland cement. Hydroxylapatite is formed by combining calcium and phosphate, and this compound forms the mineral component of the teeth and bones of animals and humans. The mineral component of some of the corals can be used to produce hydroxylapatite. Water percolating through soluble carbonates, such as limestone, dissolves rocks partially, causing the formation of stalagmites, stalactites, cave formations, and hard water. There is a variety of applications of calcium and its compounds, one being as a decarbonizer, desulfurizer, and deoxidizer. Thus, it is used in various nonferrous and ferrous alloys. It is also used as a reducing agent when thorium, zirconium, uranium, and other metals are extracted. Calcium is also used to make mortars and cements for the construction sector. In the food industry, calcium is used to produce cheese, with calcium ions influencing rennin’s activity to result in the coagulation of milk. As an alloying agent, calcium is also used to produce lead, copper, beryllium, aluminum, and magnesium alloys. Calcium compounds also have different applications, with limestone, lime, mortar, and cement being produced from calcium carbonate. It also has application in the manufacturing of glass and has optical and chemical uses in toothpastes. Calcium arsenate is a calcium compound used in insecticides. Limewater, which is a solution of calcium hydroxide, helps detect carbon dioxide by bubbling it through the hydroxide solution. When carbon dioxide is present, it turns cloudy. "
21,Scandium,Sc,44.956,"Scandium  is a rare transition metal with a silvery white color. Other rare elements are lutetium, ytterbium, thulium, erbium, and holmium. It is considered a rare element because it occurs in the same ores as other rare earth elements and has the same properties. The metal was discovered by the Swedish chemist Lars Fredrik Nilson in 1879. He was the first to detect it in gadolinite and euxenite. Scandium oxide was discovered by Per Theodor Cleve. The name of the element comes from the Latin word scandia. The metal was isolated from a mixture of scandium, lithium, and potassium chloride using electrolysis.  The scientists used molten zinc in a graphite cubicle to isolate it. It was in 1971 when alloys were produced for the first time. They were developed in the former Soviet Union and the United States. This is a soft metal that becomes pink or yellow in contact with air. It reacts with dilute acids and water and is solid at room temperature. The element has a boiling point of 2836 °C (5136.8 °F) and a melting point of 1541 °C (2805.8 °F). There are 13 radioisotopes, and Sc-46 has the longest half life (about 84 days). The isotopes are 7. Several of its compounds have been studied. There are organic derivatives, pseudohalides, halides, hydroxides, and oxides. The metal is paramagnetic with hexagonal crystal structure. There are several oxidation states but +3 is the most common one. Scandium occurs in different minerals, including gadolinite, euxenite, thortveitite, and others. The main source is thortveitite which is found in granitic pegmatites. Gadolinite is obtained from monazite which is a type of phosphate mineral. Deposits are found in different countries, including South Africa, Madagascar, and India. Minerals such as euxenite and gadolinite are found in Madagascar and Scandinavia. The metal is obtained in the form of scandia or scandium(III) oxide. There are three mining sites in Russia, China, and Ukraine where scandium is a byproduct of iron and uranium mining. In addition to uranium refining, the element can be extracted from minerals such as wiikite and bazzite. Scandium is used to manufacture glasses, energy-saving bulbs and lamps, fluorescent lamps, and TV sets. The metal is also used to manufacture lacrosse sticks, baseball bats, bikes, and alloys. Components for sports equipment such as fishing rods, bicycle frames, and golf iron shafts are produced. Scandium is mainly used in the aerospace industry. Metal halide lamps are manufactured using sodium and scandium iodide. The latter is used to manufacture mercury vapor lamps. One of the isotopes, Sc-46 has application in the oil industry and is used in oil refineries. Scandium triflate is a compound that is used in chemical reactions. Some alloys, for example, scandium-aluminum alloys can be used to produce fuel cells. Insignificant amounts of scandium are found in species. It has no biological role. However, it is released in the environment at different sites and accumulates, contributing to environmental pollution. Research shows that the metal damages the cell membranes of aquatic species leading to reproductive failure and other problems. Some compounds may have carcinogenic properties but the element itself is not toxic. Long exposure in work settings may be harmful and can cause liver damage and respiratory diseases such as lung embolism. Exposure occurs through inhalation. Scandium(III) chloride has been found to be toxic in high concentrations. Research shows that it can be lethal when ingested or inhaled by lab rats. Other compounds are moderately toxic."
22,Titanium,Ti,47.9,"Titanium  (atomic number 22, symbol Ti) is a transition metal and element from the Periodic Table that was discovered in 1791 by the British mineralogist and clergyman William Gregor who studied Cornish minerals. Titanium has a silvery-white metallic color, very high strength-to-density ratio, and good corrosion resistance. It is alloyed with different elements, including molybdenum, vanadium, aluminum, iron, and others.  At high temperatures, the element reacts with sulfur, silicon, boron, carbon, nitrogen, and other nonmetals. Compounds such as borides, carbide, and nitride have good refractory properties and are hard and stable. There are several oxidation states, including 2+ and 3+ but 4+ is the most common. The element dissolves in concentrated acids and forms a number of compounds, including halides, carbides, nitrides, sulfides, oxides, and others. Titanium dioxide occurs in 3 polymorphs, rutile, brookite, and anatase.  Five stable isotopes have been identified – Ti-48, Ti-50, Ti-49, Ti-47, and Ti-46. The half life of the most stable radioisotope, Ti-44 is 63 years. The melting point is 3020 °F (1660 °C) and the boiling point is 5948 °F (3287 °C).  This is an abundant element which is widely present in minerals and rocks, including titanite, rutile, perovskite, ilmenite, and brookite as well as sediments and different igneous rocks. The main mineral deposits are found in Australia, South Africa, Canada, Ukraine, New Zealand, China, and other countries. Canada, South Africa, and Australia are the main producers. The major deposits of rutile are found in South Africa and North America. This element has different architectural, medical, and commercial applications and is used for its autocleaning capacity and good coating power. It is added to coatings, additives, and paints and is used in plastics, toothpastes, and paper. Titanium also has many applications in medicine and is used to make cranial plates, screws, bone-plates, pace-makers, and knee and hip replacements. It is also used in the marine and aerospace industries due to its crack, fatigue, and corrosion resistance. Fire walls, structural components, hydraulic systems, exhaust ducts, and landing gear are manufactured by using alloys of titanium with vanadium, nickel, zirconium, and aluminum. Titanium dioxide is added to lacquers and enamels. The element is also used in missiles, spacecraft, naval ships, and aircraft.  It has industrial applications as well and is used in wave soldering and ultrasonic welding. Finally, titanium is also used to manufacture sporting equipment such as bicycle components, lacrosse and hockey helmet grills, golf clubs, and tennis rackets. One of its compounds, titanium tetrachloride is used as a catalyst, to make smoke screens, and for skywriting. While titanium is abundant, it has no known biological role. This is not a poisonous or toxic element and is not absorbed by the body. Long-term exposure through eye and skin contact and breathing may cause irritation, difficulty breathing, coughing, and chest pain. The element poses no environmental hazard because of its low toxicity. However, explosions can occur when titanium powder is heated, making it a fire hazard."
23,Vanadium,V,50.9415,"Vanadium  unlike other chemical elements named after their discoverers or famous scientists, Vanadium is actually named after a Scandinavian goddess called Vanadis. Physically, the element is described as solid/hard silver-grey transition metal, with relatively good ductile and malleable properties. Vanadium's melting and boiling points are known to science - 1910 C and 3407 C respectively. Vanadium has a density of 6 grams per cubic centimetre. The element is classified as a metal, which is in solid state at room temperature.Vanadium was first discovered by a Mexican chemist by the name of Andres Manuel Del Rio, in 1801. The chemist was probing into so called brown lead – a material which was still unknown at the time, and its physical and chemical properties were still unknown. Wanting to have his discovery confirmed and officialised, Del Rio sent a sample of the ore (brown lead) along with detailed notes to the Institute De France where the sample was to be analysed. A stroke of bad luck though sank the ship on which Del Rio’s notes were travelling to Paris, and in result Institute De France only received his ore samples with some brief notes on what they could be, and what they resembled in appearance and physical and chemical properties.About thirty or so years later, in 1830, the chemical element was rediscovered by a Swedish chemist by the name of Niels Sefstrom. He stumbled on it whilst running tests on different types of ore in a Swedish mine. Although Sefstrom discovered the element in its natural environment, he could not isolate or synthesise it in any way. Actual isolation of Vanadium happened 35 years later in England, by the chemist Sir Henry Roscoe. Modern day chemistry has allowed for the relatively easy isolation of Vanadium from ore by heating the crushed raw material, whilst exposing it to certain chemicals. The natural mineral from which Vanadium is derived is called vanadinite.Vanadium does have certain uses and applications, mainly because of its anticorrosive properties. Since the metal is corrosion resistant, it is used for the manufacturing of tubing and piping used in the chemical industry. As this metal doesn’t easily absorb neutrons, it also has certain applications in the atomic power industry. Vanadium is also used when bonding sheets of steel and titanium – a thin layer of Vanadium is applied to the other metals before bonding begins. Vanadium is most widely used as a strengthening additive to steel and steel alloys. It makes steel more shock resistant meaning that it becomes physically stronger, as well as highly corrosion resistant. Motor vehicles from cars to trains and ships use Vanadium in the hardest working parts of their engines like axles, crank and drive shafts, gears, and so on."
24,Chromium,Cr,51.996,"Chromium  is the first element in Group 6 of elements. The other elements in this group are transition elements. They are molybdenum (Mo), tungsten (W), and seaborgium (Sg). Chromium is steely-gray in color, hard, and with a high melting point. It is without taste and odor. The name of this element comes from the Greek word 'chroma', which actually means colour. This is because many of the compounds of this element have vibrant colors. The Chinese used this element to coat weapons as far back as two millenniums ago. In the late 18th century, this element was discovered in the mineral crocoite, which was used as a dye. In more recent times, chromium was also used to produce pigments. This element is a very hard metal and hence highly resistant to rust. Chromium plays a major role in the development and production of stainless steel. The reason is that it makes steel highly resistant to corrosion and discoloration when it is mixed into it. Another popular application of the metal is in chrome plating. Chromium is a relatively frequently found in the Earth's crust. At the same time, this element is not mined in pure form – it is mined as chromite. Around 40 percent of the chromite ores in the world are found in South Africa. The other deposits are in countries like Kazakhstan, India, and Russia as well as the Philippines, Zimbabwe, and Finland. Scientists estimate that the chromite deposits that have not been mined are far more than those which have. The reserves of chromium are estimated at one billion tones, with unexploited deposits found in Greenland. Deposits of pure chromium are very rare. There is one in Russia, which is rich in diamonds as well as chromium. Among the isotopes of this element are 53Cr, 54Cr, and 52Cr, the last being the most abundant of the three. The half-life of one of the radioisotopes of chromium is extremely long – the most stable one, 50Cr, has a half-life of over 1.8×1017 years. On the other hand, the radioisotope 51Cr has a half-life of less than 28 days. The rest of the radioactive isotopes have even shorter half-lives - under 24 hours. Some even have half-lives that last several seconds. Chromium is commonly used in metallurgy, dyes, plating, to preserve wood and tanning. Small amounts of the metal are found in high-speed tool steels, nickel-based alloys, jet engines, and gas turbines. It is the most commonly used metal coating because it is extremely durable. The element is used for chrome plating (on car and motorbike wheels) and decorative surfaces. A common pigment, used to color school buses among other things, is what is known as chrome yellow. This color does not photo degrade and is very strong. It was also used for the German postal service in the past. In addition to these applications, the element is used in metallurgy, imparting a shiny finish and corrosion resistance. The salts of chromium color glass, and it is used in the production of synthetic rubies. Chromium is also used in the tanning of leather and dyeing as well as to produce molds for brick firing. Magnetic tape is produced with the use of chromium oxide. "
25,Manganese,Mn,54.938,"Manganese  (atomic number 25, symbol Mn) is a chemical element found in many minerals and as a free element in nature. It is a silvery-gray in color and resembles iron. Manganese is difficult to fuse and very brittle, but it is easy to oxidize. The ions of manganese and the metal itself are paramagnetic. The element is named for different minerals found in the Greek region Magnesia. In the 18th century, Carl Wilhelm Scheele, a Swedish chemist, used one of them, pyrolusite to produce chlorine. He was aware that this mineral contained an unknown element but was unable to isolate it. In 1774, Johan Gottlieb Gahn reduced manganese dioxide with carbon and isolated an impure manganese sample. Scientists have characterized 18 radioisotopes of magnesium, and magnesium-55, magnesium-53, and magnesium-54 are the most stable of them. The half-life of magnesium-55 is 3.7 million years. The half-life of its other radioisotopes is less than 3 hours. Magnesium also has 3 meta states (nuclear isomers). This element is essential to steel and iron production. Steel production accounts for 85 percent to 90 percent of the total demand. In addition, manganese is a major element of some widely used alloys of aluminum and is employed in stainless steel formulation. Manganese is also used to produce violet colored class and to decolorize glass, with manganese dioxide being used as a catalyst. Potassium permanganate is used as a disinfectant, and it is a powerful oxidizer. Manganese carbonate and manganese oxide also have applications. The latter is used in ceramics and fertilizers, and the former goes into various manganese compounds.  Manganese dioxide or manganese (IV) oxide has application in organic chemistry and is used to oxidize benzylic alcohols. Manganese dioxide is also used to produce chlorine and oxygen, and in drying black paints. In addition, manganese is used to produce coins. The wartime nickel is the only US coin to contain manganese until 2000. Traditionally, an alloy of 25 percent nickel and 75 percent copper was used to produce nickel coins. Due to shortage of nickel, manganese and silver substituted it during the war. The resulting alloy was made of 9 percent manganese, 35 percent silver, and 56 percent copper. Since 2000, Presidential $1 coins, the Sacagawea dollar, and other dollar coins have been produced from brass and contain 5 percent manganese. The use of the alloy aims to duplicate the properties of the nickel/ copper alloy. Manganese is among the most abundant metals found in soils, occurring in the form of hydroxides and oxides. The element occurs as rhodochrosite and pyrolusite. The estimated reserves of manganese are over 3 billion tonnes, and the major mining sites are in Australia, Ukraine, Gabon, Georgia, Russia, and South Africa. Other mining sites are found in Mexico, Kazakhstan, and Ghana.This element is vital for all species. Sponges, mollusks, diatoms, and other organisms accumulate manganese. Mammals have up to 3 ppm and fish up to 5 ppm in their tissues. The side effects of manganese poisoning occur mostly in the brain and the respiratory tract. Symptoms include nerve damage, forgetfulness, and hallucinations. Manganese poisoning can cause bronchitis, lung embolism, Parkinson, and impotency. A syndrome caused by the element has symptoms like headaches, weak muscles, dullness, insomnia, and schizophrenia. Shortages of manganese cause glucose intolerance, skeleton disorders, skin problems, and birth defects. "
26,Iron,Fe,55.847,"Iron  is a chemical element and a metal belonging to the first transition series. Iron is one of the most common elements in the Earth's crust, and it is abundant in rocky planets, resulting from fusion in high-mass stars. Iron is also the most common element which forms the Earth (by mass), and it forms its inner and outer core Elemental iron is present in low-oxygen environments such as meteoroids, and it is reactive to water and oxygen. While fresh iron is silver-gray and lustrous, it gives iron oxides upon oxidation in normal air. The element exists in 4 crystalline forms and forms two series of compounds – ferrous or bivalent iron (II) compounds and ferric or trivalent iron (III) compounds. Iron dissolves in dilute acids and rusts in damp air. This metal has been used since ancient times, and beads from iron date back to 3500 BC. Today, the production of steel or iron takes place in two stages, unless cast iron is to be produced. During the first stage of the process, pig iron is produced in a blast furnace. Then, steel or wrought iron is made from pig iron. The chemical compounds of iron, including ferric and ferrous compounds, have multiple applications. The mixture of aluminum powder and iron oxide, for example, can be ignited, and it creates a thermite reaction. It is used for purifying and welding ores. Binary compounds with the chalcogens and halogens are also formed. The production of steel, which is an alloy of carbon and iron, requires large amounts of iron. Steel usually contains between 0.3 percent and 1.5 percent of carbon, and this depends on the desired characteristics. Other elements can be added to steel to give it useful properties. For example, when small amounts of chromium are added, it prevents dust and improves durability. Adding nickel improves resistance to acids and heat and increases durability. Molybdenum improves resistance to heat and increases strength while manganese improves resistance to wear and increases strength. When added, vanadium increases springiness and strength, and tungsten helps retain hardness at high temperatures. Steel has many applications and is used to make skyscrapers, paper clips, and anything in between. In nature, most of the iron is found in the composition of different iron oxides, for example, minerals such as taconite, magnetite, and hematite. It is believed that the core of the earth is made mostly of an iron-nickel alloy. This element is also essential to life on Earth, from humans to microorganisms. It can be found in vegetables, potatoes, whole meal products, and meat. Iron found in animal products is absorbed by the body faster than iron in plant products. This element is an important component of hemoglobin: the blood’s red-colored agent, which transports oxygen. At the same time, if iron remains in the body tissues, it can cause retinitis, choroiditis, and conjunctivitis. The repeated inhalation of iron oxide dusts and fumes in excessive concentrations may lead to benign pneumoconiosisThe production of iron globally reaches more than 500 million tonnes per year. The economically workable iron ore reserves are estimated at over 100 billion tonnes. The major mining sites are found in Ukraine, Russia, Austria, Brazil, and China. In addition, considerable amounts are mined in India, Sweden, Canada, and the United States. "
27,Cobalt,Co,58.993,"Cobalt  is a chemical element occurring naturally only in a combined compound form. When isolated, it is a silver-gray, lustrous, hard metal. It is used quite effectively as a blue pigment and has been used this way since antiquity for jewelry and other decorative items, to give glass a blue tinge, and more. Eventually, it emerged that the metal bismuth had this function. This metal is also known as goblin ore (German) because of the blue color it produced and because it gives off poisonous fumes upon smelting. The new metal, to which these ores were found to be reducible, came to be known as cobalt. Today, this substance is derived from different metallic-luster ores, but it is mainly a by-product of copper and nickel extraction. Most cobalt that is mined in the world comes from Zambia and Congo. The element is also produced as a byproduct of the extraction and refining of lead, silver, iron, copper, and nickel. Cobalt is an element, without which animals cannot function. It is vital for their biological survival, health, and growth. Cobalt is also an important nutrient for bacteria, algae, and fungi.  This element is the center of vitamin B12 (thiamine). Drastic deficiency of this enzyme results in Korsakoff’s syndrome, which strikes people with severe drinking problems. The condition is also known as Korsakoff’s psychosis, Korsakoff’s dementia, and amnesic-confabulatory syndrome. Its onset is associated with severe malnutrition, alcohol abuse, eating disorders, prolonged vomiting, or the effects of chemotherapy.  Cobalt deficiency, which is a rate condition, can be potentially lethal. It may lead to pernicious anemia while excessive levels of cobalt may cause death. Cobalt poisoning is a form of intoxication whereby cobalt reaches excessive levels in the body. Cobalt is used mostly as a metal in alloys with low wear-and-tear properties and high strength. It is also used often in magnetic alloys. Alloys are solid solutions consisting of two elements or more. Cobalt blue (cobalt aluminate) is used to color glass, ink, varnish, paint, smalt and ceramics. A radioactive isotope of cobalt, cobalt-60, is used as a radioactive tracer. This means it can measure the speed of chemical processes and track the movement of a substance through a cell or tissue, making it very useful in medicine and medical technology. It is also used to produce gamma rays. Alnico is an alloy made of cobalt, nickel, and aluminum, used in the production of powerful, permanent magnets. Alloys which contain cobalt are also used to manufacture magnetic steels, gas turbines, jet engines, and some kinds of stainless steel. Stellite alloys with tungsten, chromium, and cobalt are used to make high-temperature and high-speed cutting tools. The element is mostly used in alloys, batteries, as a catalyst, and in pigments and coloring. An oxide of the metal, lithium cobalt oxide, is often used in the production of lithium ion battery cathodes. Several combined chemical forms containing cobalt are used as oxidation catalysts. Some typical catalysts include cobalt soap, known officially as cobalt carboxylate. These substances are also used to improve the adhesion of the steel to rubber in tires. These catalysts are also used in reactions involving carbon monoxide, hydrogen production, hydrogenation of carbon monoxide into liquid fuels, hydroformylation of alkenes, hydrodesulfurization of petroleum, and more. Cobalt-57 is a radioactive isotope of the element commonly used in medical tests.

28,Nickel,Ni,58.693,"Nickel  (atomic number 28, symbol Ni) is a lustrous metal with a silvery-white color and slight golden tinge. The element is ductile and hard and belongs to the group of transition metals. Nickel is one of the 4 chemical elements with magnetic properties near or at room temperature. The others are gadolinium, cobalt, and iron. Axel Fredrik Cronstedt was the first to isolate and classify nickel in 1751. Today, major production sites include Norilsk in Russia, New Caledonia, and Sudbury region in Canada. The most important ore minerals of nickel are pentlandite, garnierite, and limonite. The bulk of nickel is mined from laterites and magmatic sulfide deposits, with major ore minerals being pentlandite and nickeliferous limonite. Around room temperature, the element is ferromagnetic, and nickel-based magnets are of intermediate strength between rare-earth magnets and iron-based magnets. Nickel is valuable for the alloys it forms, including new superalloys and nickel-steels. This element has a number of commercial applications – 9 percent of the global nickel production is used to make Iconel, nickel clad, malleable nickel, and other superalloys; 6 percent is used in plating, 3 percent in electronic and heat resistance alloys, 3 percent for nickel cast irons, and 2 percent for nickel bronzes and brasses. The element is also used in a variety of recognizable and specific consumer and commercial products such as coinage, stainless steel, electric guitar strings, and rechargeable batteries. Nickel is also used in the production of alnico magnets and microphone capsules. It is mainly an alloy metal, which is added to nickel cast irons and nickel steels, of which there are many varieties. Nickel is widely used in other alloys, including bronzes and brasses, and alloys with cobalt, lead, aluminum, and copper. Because it resists corrosion, the element is used in rocket engines and gas turbines. Nickel mesh or nickel foam is used in the production of gas diffusion electrodes while nickel alloys have application as catalysts for different hydrogenation reactions. Most nickel is found in the earth’s iron-nickel core, which makes it inaccessible. Organic matter absorbs it, and this is why oil and coal contain considerable amounts. Nickel is also an important component of some enzymes in beans. The element occurs combined with sulphur and arsenic in nickel glance, with arsenic in niccolite, and with sulphur in millerite. The metal is mined in South Africa, Canada, Cuba, Nova Caledonia, Australia, and Russia. Nickel does not bio magnify up the food chain, and it is not known to accumulate in animal and plant species. Some microorganisms may experience growth decline, but they tend to develop resistance with time. Food contains small amounts of nickel, but fats and chocolate have high quantities. Nickel uptake also increases when people consume vegetables from heavily polluted soils. The element is also found in some detergents. Humans are exposed to nickel by smoking cigarettes, eating food, drinking water, and breathing. It is beneficial in small quantities but can be a health hazard if the uptake is high. Side effects include respiratory failure, lung embolism, heart disorders, and skin rashes and other allergic reactions. Dizziness and sickness have been reported after exposure to nickel gas. Exposure can lead to the development of nose cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, and larynx cancer. Once acquired, nickel sensitivity persists indefinitely. "
29,Copper,Cu,63.54,"Copper  is a stretchable metal that is extremely conductive when it comes to heat and electricity. Pure copper is malleable and reddish-orange in color. Copper is often used in construction and is part of a number of different metal alloys. Copper has been used since antiquity, both on its own and in alloys. In Roman times, this metal was mined chiefly on the island of Cyprus and used to be called cyprium. In ancient times, bronze was used to make ornamental items, containers, weapons, and tools. Brass, which contains zinc and copper, was used as far back as 2,500 years ago. The Romans used brass extensively to make ornamental objects, kettles, and coins. Today, it is used in the production of objects, which should resist corrosion, such as screws, musical instruments, and different hardware. The compounds of copper give blue or green tinges to semi-precious stones and minerals like turquoise and have been used as pigments throughout history. Copper is frequently used in decorative art as well, both as part of pigments and on its own. Buildings are constructed with copper to obtain what is known as patina – when copper, bronze, or brass structures are exposed to air and water (rain) for some time. This patina is also known as verdigris. It is green in color and very pretty. All the ions of copper are soluble in water. In small amounts they can function to prevent fungi and as wood preservatives. In large amounts they can be very dangerous to humans and animals. In smaller amounts, they are necessary for the survival of all higher plant and animal life. Copper can be found in animal tissues, liver, muscles, and bones. Copper is used in electric wires, roofing, plumbing, industrial machinery, and more. Being highly conductive, copper is used to make copper wires and electric magnets. Copper is used instead of aluminum in circuit boards because it is more conductive. It is often used in cathode ray tubes, vacuum tubes, and microwave ovens. Roofs of buildings are also often made of copper because it is waterproof. Lightning rods are made of copper so that electric current passes through the ground instead of the building, which it would destroy if it did. It is easy to weld copper; the best way to do this is through gas metal arc welding. There are many copper alloys. One example is brass. Copper is an important component of gold and carat silver alloys. It is frequently used in the jewelry business to change the melting point, hardness, and color of the resulting compounds. The best known compound of copper is hydrated copper sulfate. Also called blue vitrol, this compound is used in water purification, as an agricultural poison, and as a blue pigment. Another compound of copper, cuperic chloride is used for fixing dyes to fabrics. Copper cyanide is yet another compound, which is used in electroplating. Copper resists corrosion from seawater, moisture, and air, and is widely used in the mintage of coins. American pennies were made from copper in the past, but today zinc is coated with copper. The US 5-cent coin is three-quarters copper and one-quarter nickel. It is called a nickel erroneously. Copper is known to destroy many microorganisms, like the E. coli bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, influenza A virus, fungi, etc. "

The element reacts with dilute acids and nonmetals. The melting point is 788 F (420 C) and the boiling point is 1664 F (907 C). Zinc combines with a number of elements, including tellurium, nickel, cobalt, magnesium, and tin. The metal also forms alloys with silver, lead, iron, gold, and bismuth. Binary alloys are also formed when zinc reacts with antimony, aluminum, and copper. The element has a hexagonal packed structure and 10 isotopes. Zn-64 is the most abundant one. The element is found in minerals such as hydrozincite, wurtzite, hemimorphite, smithsonite, and others. It occurs in soil, water, and air, and significant deposits are found in countries such as Iran, the U.S., Canada, and Australia. This element has a number of commercial applications and is used to make different alloys. It alloys with magnesium, aluminum, and copper, and the alloys are used in the hardware, vehicle manufacturing, and other industries. It is alloyed with tin and lead to produce solder which is used for joining elements such as pipes and electrical components. American pennies are made using zinc in combination with other elements. Zinc also has applications in rubber manufacturing, inks, wallpaper and photocopier paper, cosmetics, and plastics. It is mainly used as a pigment. Zinc alloys have different applications and are commonly used for bending, roll forming, and deep drawing. One of its compounds, zinc oxide is used in photocopying and varistors due to its good semiconductor properties. Zinc is also added to different mineral, vitamin, and other dietary supplements. It helps strengthen the immune response. Zinc is found in different foods, including wheat germ, lamb and beef, squash and pumpkin seeds, seafood, and spinach. It occurs free in nature and has antioxidant properties. High concentrations at waste sites increase the risk for health problems. Side effects include gastritis, diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, and other gastrointestinal problems. Other side effects are dyspepsia, stomachache, and unpleasant taste. High concentrations of zinc affect protein metabolism. It is a health hazard for newborn and unborn babies. Exposure occurs through breast milk and blood. At the same time, zinc is used to treat different illnesses and disorders, including anorexia nervosa, peptic ulcers, Hansen’s disease, Down syndrome, and Alzheimer’s disease. It is also used to treat Crohn’s disease, serious head injuries, tinnitus, and attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder. People at risk of zinc deficiency include lactating women, expectant mothers, vegetarians and vegans, and patients with gastrointestinal problems."
31,Gallium,Ga,69.72,"Gallium  Brittle at low temperatures, gallium becomes a liquid when the temperature rises to around 25 degrees Celsius. It can melt in your hand at room temperature. A compound of Ga, gallium arsenide, is used in semiconductors. Other two compounds of this element, gallium nitride and indium gallium nitride, are used to produce diode lasers. Almost all of the gallium in the world is used in semiconductors at the present time, but new uses are constantly being found. One emerging use is in medicine as a way to treat inflammation. The use of certain gallium salts is believed to be important for treatment. Production and use of the metal in semiconductors are relatively cheap. Some compounds of the element are used in electronic components, optoelectronics, and infrared applications. Other compounds of gallium are used in light-emitting diodes, multi-junction photo-voltaic cells, satellites, solar panels, and more. The compounds of gallium also have medical uses. For example, Gallium nitrate (better known as Ganite) has been known to treat hypercalcemia in the wake of tumor metastasis. Forms of gallium ions are used to treat certain types of cancer, inflammation and infections. It may potentially help treat cystic fibrosis and malaria.Liquid gallium is used to wet glass and porcelain surfaces, forming a reflective, and bright surface when it is coated on glass. Brilliant mirrors can be created using it. Low-melting alloys are formed by using gallium because it alloys with most metals. An alloy of gallium is used in nuclear weapons’ plutonium pits as to stabilize the allotropes of plutonium. The production of high temperature thermometers and analog integrated circuits also involves the use of gallium. The element does not occur naturally, but can easily be derived by smelting. In completely pure form, it can break like glass. When it becomes solid, it expands by 3.1 percent. This is why, it should not be kept in metal or glass containers. Its density is very high in liquid form, comparable only to the density of germanium, antimony, silicon, water, and bismuth. The ultra pure form of gallium is silvery in color and has a beautiful appearance. The conchoidal fracture characteristic of the solid metal is similar to glass. Gallium was discovered by use of a spectroscope in 1875. That same year it was derived as a free metal by means of electrolysis. Today, the element is frequently obtained as a by-product of zinc and aluminum. The amount of 184 tons of gallium was produced in 2007, mostly from mining. A number of processes are required for the production of pure gallium, which end with zone refining. It is used to produce pure gallium metal. Gallium is not considered toxic, but this does not mean you shouldn’t be careful. When divided, gallium loses its shimmer and appears gray in color. As a result, when it is handled with bare hands, you may get gray skin stains."
32,Germanium,Ge,72.63,"Germanium The element  is known by the symbol Ge, and its atomic number is 32. It was named by the German scientist Clemens Winkler after his country. Germanium is grayish-white in color, hard, and shimmers. It is semi-metal, which is solid at room temperature. A member of the carbon group of elements, its chemical makeup is similar to that of silicon and tin. This element has five isotopes, which occur in nature, and forms a number of compounds as well. It is used in semiconductors, fiber-optic systems, infrared optics, and in other electronics. Recently, it is also being used in nanowires. The main source of germanium is sphalerite, but it can also be found in copper, silver, and lead ores. Crystalline germanium has been produced using zone refining techniques. There is no need to produce germanium in laboratory conditions because it is available commercially. However, germanium is a relatively rare metal and 1 kg cost $800 in 1999. When handling certain germanium compounds, it is necessary to take precaution, because they can cause inflammation of the eyes, skin, lungs, and throat. There are five naturally occurring isotopes of this element - Ge 70, Ge 72, Ge 73, Ge 74, and Ge 76. The last one is a little radioactive with the notable half-life of 1.78 × 1021 yr. The isotope of germanium that is most frequently found is Ge 74. The least common is Ge 76. Around 27 synthetic isotopes of this element exist. Their atomic mass ranges from 58 to 89. Germanium also occurs in the atmospheres of distant stars and planets, such as Jupiter. A number of minerals, such as argyrodite and briartite, contain substantial quantities of germanium. It is not very easy to produce germanium. Worldwide production averages about 100 tons per year. One-third of the demand for germanium is met by recycled germanium. Some coal deposits have large amounts of germanium, especially those found in Russia and China, where coal deposits are frequently used as a source. Germanium is used for polymerization catalysts, although that is not the most popular use. A small amount goes for phosphors, chemotherapy, and metallurgy. This element is exceptionally useful for the core part of optical fibers, microscopy and wide-angle camera lenses because of its low optical dispersion and high index of refraction. It is also widely used for silica fibers. Compounds including germanium are used in the production of rewritable DVDs. This element is transparent, which is why it can easily be used to make lenses and windows after it is polished. It is also used in thermal imaging cameras, to detect military targets, for night vision system in cars, and in the fire fighting sector. When germanium is doped with indium, gallium, arsenic, phosphorus, or antimony, it is used to produce transistors for some electronic devices. In fluorescent lamps, germanium is used as a phosphor. It is also added to alloys. Germanium oxide and germanium have application in infrared detectors and infrared optical devices and are transparent to radiation. Some of the compounds of germanium destroy certain types of bacteria. They are characterized with a low mammalian toxicity. The properties of these compounds are studied to be used in chemotherapy. An important new use of germanium is in solar panels.

33,Arsenic,As,74.922,"Arsenic The element  is found in the earth's crust, occurring naturally in our planet's environment. It is combined with elements such as sulfur, chlorine, and oxygen and forms different inorganic arsenic compounds. Exposure to levels of arsenic that are higher-than-overage may occur in water, rocks, and soils with naturally occurring high levels. Exposure is also possible in or near hazardous waste sites and workplaces close to such areas. Long-term exposure to low levels of arsenic can result in the appearance of small-size warts and corns and discoloration of the skin. High levels of arsenic are dangerous to human health and can cause death. Exposures to this element are addressed in industry-specific standards for the construction industry, shipyard employment, and the general industry. Arsenic (atomic number 33, symbol As) occurs as a pure crystal as well as in many minerals. This element is a metalloid and is found in different allotropes (structural modifications of chemical elements). The grey from has found important applications in the industry. Metallic arsenic is mainly used to strengthen alloys of lead (e.g. in automotive batteries) and copper. Arsenic is also among the most commonly used semiconductors and makes the compound gallium arsenide, which is optoelectronic. Arsenic, together with its compounds, is employed in the production of insecticides, herbicides, and pesticides. Some bacteria species are arsenic-tolerant and use the compounds of arsenic as respiratory metabolites. Arsenic has a toxic effect on more complex life forms because of the interaction of protein thiols and arsenic ions. Between the 18th and 20th century, the compounds of arsenic were used for medicinal purposes. Now, some compounds are used as a wood preservative and in the production of special kind of glass. Gallium arsenide, for example, converts electronic currents into laser light. An important dopant gas is the arsine gas AsH3, which is used in the microchip industry. Due to its very toxic nature, strict guidelines for its use have been developed. The three allotropic forms of arsenic are grey, black, and yellow. Its stable form is a crystalline, bristle, silver-gray solid. Metallic arsenic is brittle and forms arsenic trioxide through oxidation when heated. While the non-metallic arsenic is less reactive, it dissolves at high temperatures when reacting with alkalis and strong oxidizing acids. Arsenic is found in three types of compounds – alloys, organoarsenic compounds, and inorganic compounds. The element forms crystalline, odorless, and colorless oxides. Well-know inorganic compounds are triiodide, tribromide, trichloride, and trifluoride.There is a variety of organoarsenic compounds as well. Several of them were developed during the First World War as chemical warfare agents. Among them are lewisite and adamsite, which is a vomiting agent. Cacodylic acid is formed from arsenic trioxide through methylation, a reaction that is unique in phosphorus chemistry. In the environment, arsenic comes from a variety of sources. Volcanoes, for example, release some 3,000 tons every year while methylarsines, formed by the activity of microorganisms, make for additional 20,000 a year. Arsenic is produced by human activity in much greater quantities, however, especially when fossil fuels are burnt. This element is very hard to convert into volatile and water-soluble products. Large concentrations of arsenic are unlikely to occur in a certain area because it is a fairly mobile element. However, because arsenic spreads easily, environmental pollution becomes an issue. Moreover, even when the element is immobile, it cannot be mobilized. "
34,Selenium,Se,78.96,"Selenium  This element is semiconductor and conducts electricity. Black selenium is solid, lustrous, and brittle and forms red selenium through evaporation. Five stable isotopes occur in nature – Se-80, Se-78, Se-77, Se-76, and Se-74. Se-80 is a key isotope. The element also forms different compounds such as selenides, halogen compounds, and chalcogen compounds, including sodium selenite, silver selenite, selenium trioxide, selenous acid, and others. Selenides also form, for example, copper indium gallium, zinc, lead, and mercury selenides. These compounds are semiconductors. Other compounds are explosive. One example is etraselenium tetranitride. The element is also found in different inorganic forms such as minerals that contain selenite, selenate, and selenide acid. Selenium dichloride is an example of an inorganic compound, but it has no commercial application. The element itself is usually obtained from lead, nickel, copper, and other sulfide ores. Its physical properties resemble the properties of tellurium and sulfur. Common oxidation states include -2, +4, and +6. It is solid at room temperature. The boiling point is 1,265 °F (685°C), and the melting point is 428.9°F (220.5°C). Selenium has a number of applications in different industries. It is used to produce solar cells, photocells, alloys, and glass. It has photoconductive and photovoltaic properties. The element is added to stainless steel and used as a gamma source and in photographic toners.  It is also added to rectifiers, storage batteries, and metal alloys. Some of its compounds, for example, selenium sulfide are added to anti dandruff shampoos. It is used in food supplements and animal feeds as well.Deficiency increases the risk for medical conditions such as the Kashin-Beck disease, infertility and reproductive problems, mental fatigue, hyperthyroidism, and others. Side effects include sensitivity to light, emotional disturbance, and heart palpitations. Deficiency is more common in countries and regions that are low in selenium, including Siberia, Tibet, China, and others. Deficiency is uncommon in countries such as Canada and the U.S., but some groups are at risk. In addition to populations living in low-selenium regions, HIV-positive patients and patients on kidney dialysis are at a higher risk. Deficiency also increases the risk for cretinism in babies. Research studies show that proper nutrition and intake may help prevent diseases and chronic conditions such as thyroid disease, cognitive problems, cardiovascular problems, and cancer. One of the reasons is that this element has antioxidant properties. Selenium supplements lower the risk of cardiac death and coronary heart disease. Overexposure can be a health hazard, however, as the element is toxic if taken in large doses. Exposure occurs through inhalation, contact with soil, and water and food. Overexposure to fumes leads to abdominal pain, sore throat, fever, nausea, bronchial asthma, and enlarged liver. In animals, it leads to birth defects and fertility problems. In general, people who work at mining sites and selenium-recovery industries must exercise caution. The tolerable intake levels depend on age and sex."
35,Bromine,Br,79.909,"Bromine  is a chemical element belonging to the halogen group. It is the only nonmetallic, liquid element and a reddish brown, mobile, volatile, and heavy liquid. The vapor irritates the throat and eyes and has an unpleasant, strong odor.  Elemental bromine exists in a liquid form at room temperature and is toxic and corrosive. Its properties are similar to those of iodine and chlorine. Free bromine is not found it nature, and occurs in the form of soluble, colorless, crystalline halide salts.  Bromine was first isolated in the period 1825 - 1826 by the chemists Antoine Jerome and Carl Jacob Löwig, who were working independently. When the young student of chemistry Carl Löwig produced bromine, he showed it to his instructor Leopold Gmelin. The professor realized that the chemical was an unknown substance and asked Löwig to produce more of it so that it can be studied in detail. Holidays and exams delayed Löwig long enough for Antoine-Jérôme Balard, also a chemistry student, to publish a research paper on the new element. Antoine-Jérôme Balard was credited with bromine’s discovery and named the element after bromos, which is a Greek word for stench. This element is rarer than around three fourths of the chemical elements in the earth’s crust. The bromide ion’s high solubility, however, has led to its accumulation in the oceans. Bromine is commercially extracted in China, Israel, and the United States from brine pools.It should be noted that elemental bromine is a dangerous material, and in contact with the skin, it causes severe burns. Its vapor irritates the throat, nose, and eyes. In the US, most of the bromine was used to manufacture the chemical ethylene dibromide. Leaded gasolines that prevented lead compounds from accumulating in the engine contained it before the use of leaded gasolines was discontinued. Unleaded gasolines were then introduced, and the demand for bromine dropped considerably. Today, bromide is mostly used in the form of silver bromide, which has application in photography. Bromine has other applications as well, as a flame retardant, pesticide, and gasoline additive. Bromine-based flame retardants have a growing commercial importance, and this is the most common use of bromine. The burning of brominated material generates hybrobromic acid, interfering in fire’s oxidation reaction. Hydroxy radicals and hydrogen oxygen react with the acid, forming free bromine atoms, which are less reactive radicals of bromine. Methyl bromide is a poisonous substance that was commonly used as a pesticide. Ethylene bromide had a similar application. Being ozone depletion agents, these volatile compounds are regulated today. Prior to the 1991 adoption of the Montreal protocol, bromide was used to control weeds, fungi, nematodes, and other soil-borne diseases. Similarly, due to environmental regulations, the use of bromide as a gasoline additive has declined since the 70s. Ethylene bromide was formerly used as an additive in gasolines that contained anti-engine knocking agents. Compounds of bromide are also used in medicine. Potassium bromide, in particular, was used as a sedative in the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century. As simple salts, bromides are used today as anticonvulsants in human and veterinary medicine, but their use differs between countries. Notably, the prolonged use of potassium bromide causes bromism, which is an uncommon disorder nowadays. In the past, bromism was responsible for five to ten percent of all psychiatric admissions. "
36,Krypton,Kr,83.8,"Krypton  is a chemical element and a tasteless, odorless, and colorless noble gas, which is inert. It is characterized by several spectral signatures or sharp emission lines, and the strongest of them are yellow and green. Krypton has 30 isomers and unstable isotopes and 6 stable isotopes. One of them, Kr-81 occurs with other isotopes of the element and is created as a result of atmospheric reactions. Due to its radioactivity, the half-life of krypton-81 is 230,000 years. It has application in dating old ground water, but near surface water, the isotope is highly volatile. The element was discovered by Morris Travers and Sir William Ramsay in 1898 in Britain. The chemists discovered neon a couple of weeks later, and Ramsey received the Noble Prize in Chemistry in 1904 for the discovery of krypton and other noble gases. Given the high costs of obtaining the element, krypton does not have many practical applications. One is in high speed photography, and krypton is used in some kinds of photographic flashes. A mixture of argon and krypton is used to fill some types of fluorescent light bulbs. In combination with other gases, krypton is used to create luminous signs with yellow-greenish light. One important application of krypton is in the usage and production of fluoride laser, which is used in confinement experiments related to nuclear fusion energy. The laser modifies spot size, has short wavelength and high beam uniformity, which makes it possible to track imploding pellets. A mixture of unstable and stable isotopes of the element is used to slow uranium’s neutron fission. The most stable isotope of krypton, krypton-85 helps detect leakage in sealed containers. Abnormal heart openings are detected using krypton-85 as well. In the absence of sources of energy, the isotope is used to excite phosphors in a light source. Krypton-83, another isotope of the element, is used for imaging airways in MRI (magnetic resonance imaging). More specifically, krypton-83 is issued to differentiate between hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces that contain an airway. In addition, xenon can be used to assess ventilation in computed tomography.Notably, this element is among the rarest gases found in the earth’s atmosphere. At the same time, while there are over 15 billion tonnes of krypton out there, just 8 tonnes of those circulating are extracted. Extraction of krypton can take place through fractional distillation. According to some, the amount of krypton existing in space is not certain, because it is derived from solar winds and meteoric activity. Preliminary measurements have suggested that the element is abundant in space. Krypton is classified as an inert gas, and it is a simple asphyxiant. In case excessive amounts are inhaled, this can cause vomiting, nausea, dizziness, loss of consciousness, and even death. Death is usually the result of loss of consciousness, confusion, and errors in judgment, preventing self-rescue. Death and loss of consciousness occur without warning and in seconds at low concentrations of oxygen. The first symptoms are air hunger and rapid respiration, impaired muscular coordination and diminished mental alertness. Fatigue occurs quickly due to emotional instability, followed by convulsions, comma, and ultimately death. With regards to environmental effects, the element is chemically inert and non-toxic. At extremely cold temperatures, it freezes organisms, but no long-term effects are expected. "
37,Rubidium,Rb,85.47,"Rubidium Rubidium is water reactive and non-radioactive. It is found in minerals such as zinnwaldite, carnallite, pollucite, leucite, and others. The metal also occurs in potassium chlorides, potassium minerals, and lepidolite. Its main isotopes are rubidium-87 and rubidium-85, and the isotopes are 11 in total. Radioisotopes such as Ru-95 and Ru-97 have been isolated in laboratory conditions. Other isotopes are produced synthetically but have few applications due to their high radioactivity. They also have comparatively shorter half lives of less than 3 months. The two main mining sites are found on the island of Elba and in Manitoba, Canada. The Canadian site has rich deposits of pollucite, which also contains caesium. It is usually isolated as a byproduct of lithium extraction. The fact that it is widely scattered explains why production is more limited. The metal is extracted in the form of potassium carbonate which is used to produce glass, wine, grass jelly, and soap. The salt contains small quantities of caesium carbonates and rubidium. Another problem is that the metal is found together with other alkalis such as caesium and extraction requires ion-exchange methods. One way to extract metals is reduction with sodium or calcium and another is electrolysis. Another problem is that the metal ignites in air which makes processing more difficult. The fact that there are few commercial applications can be explained with the complex extraction, limited supply, and high prices. Its compounds, however, have different commercial applications. Compounds that are used in different industries include rubidium silver iodide, carbonate, copper sulfate, and hydroxide. Rubidium carbonate, for example, is used to produce optical glasses. The metal also has many halides, salts, and oxides, including rubidium iodide, bromide, chloride, fluoride, and monoxide.The metal has different applications and is used to produce gases, for condensation, and in thermoelectric generators. In addition, rubidium is used in the ceramics and glass industries and to produce photocells. Other applications have been explored as well, including ion engines for spacecraft. The metal is also used for scientific research. It is alloyed with gold and mercury to make dental amalgams. In addition, rubidium is used to produce fireworks while one of its isotopes, rubidium-87 is used in the development of magnetometers with high sensitivity. It is a relatively common isotope. Wieman, Ketterle, and Cornell won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2001 for producing Bose-Einstein condensate from rubidium-87. This is a form of matter whereby subatomic particles and atoms come together to form a single entity. This metal is toxic when ingested. Chemical burns of the skin and eyes are possible. In case of exposure to high concentrations, there are signs and side effects such as nervousness, skin ulcers, irritation, and ataxia. Patients with cardiovascular problems and those with potassium imbalance must be extra cautious, and medical treatment may be required in some cases. Side effects usually occur as a result of ingestion, inhalation, and skin contact. Contaminated clothes should be removed immediately. Rubidium is not considered an environmental hazard. "
38,Strontium,Sr,87.62,"Strontium  (atomic number 38, symbol Sr) is an alkaline earth metal that is commercially available. Its chemical and physical properties are similar to that of elements such as barium and calcium. It was discovered in 1790 by the Scottish chemist William Cruickshank and the physician and chemist Adair Crawford.  The element reacts vigorously when in contact with water and tarnishes in air. With water, it forms hydrogen gas and strontium hydroxide, which is a caustic alkali, causing severe lung, eye, and skin irritation. There are two oxidation states - 1 and 2 - and 4 stable isotopes - Sr-88, Sr-87, Sr-86, and Sr-84. In general, the radioactive isotopes of the element share the same properties. The properties of Sr-90 are similar to that of calcium. The element also forms compounds such as carbonates and nitrates, including strontium nitrate and carbonate. There are different applications of strontium and its compounds, including strontium barium niobate, renelate, oxide, aluminate, and titanite. The latter is used in the optics industry and in thermoelectric generators. Strontium oxide is another compound that is used to enhance pottery glazes. The element and its isotopes also have applications. Sr-90, for example, is used for cancer treatment. It is also used in agricultural and medical research and to manufacture portable power devices. They are especially useful in spacecraft, weather stations, navigational beacons, and remote locations with no power supply. In addition, it is added to industrial gauges and electron tubes.  Sr-89 is used in therapies for metastatic bone cancer. Strontium chloride, which is a salt, is used in research and for dental care. Strontium ranelate prevents bone loss and facilitates bone tissue formation. It is used in therapies and treatments intended for patients with osteoporosis. Research also shows that some of its radioactive forms eliminate cancer cells. Other studies suggest that the element can be used to treat osteoporosis and increase bone density, to prevent cavities, and to improve cartilage metabolism. Thus, it can be used in therapies intended for patients with arthritis. The element occurs in the form of carbonate strontianite and celestite and is found in mining sites in Spain, Turkey, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. Sr-90 is an isotope and a byproduct of plutonium and uranium processing in nuclear reactors. It is also found in nuclear waste and contributes to pollution. Some of its isotopes are radioactive, for example, Sr-90 and increase the risk for bone cancer and other bone disorders. Exposure occurs through drinking, eating, inhalation, dust, and skin contact. Significant amounts of Sr-90 were released in the atmosphere after the Chernobyl accident. While strontium is dissolved in water, small amounts accumulate in soils and remain there for many years. The element is rarely found in drinking water. Radioactive leaks and nuclear weapon tests are potential hazards. Water-soluble strontium is also a health hazard in that it can be found in drinking water. Foods that contain higher concentrations include dairies, green leafy vegetables, grains, and others. Sr-90 is found in milk. Vegetables that contain significant amounts of strontium include celery, potatoes, beans, peas, carrots, lettuce, and others. California cabbage and lettuce contain Sr-90. The amount is insignificant which makes consumption safe. Overexposure is associated with side effects such as fainting, blood clots, skin irritation, nausea, and others. Strontium chromate is one compound that is considered a health hazard because of its toxic properties. Research shows that chronic exposure increases the risk for lung cancer. Strontium bursts into flame when in contact with air and for this reason, kerosene is used for storage."
39,Yttrium,Y,88.905,"Yttrium  (symbol Y, atomic number 39) is a chemical element classified as a rare earth element, which is never found naturally as a free element. The element atomic weight of 88.9. Its melting and boiling points are known to be 1522 C, and 3345 C respectively. Yttrium's density is pinpointed at 4.47 grams per cubic centimetre. Classified as metal, it is in a solid state at room temperature. Yttrium (not to be confused with ytterbium) is also named after the Swedish village of Ytterby where it was first discovered. In physical appearance, Yttrium appears as a silvery-metallic, lustrous, soft, and highly crystalline transition metal from Group 3 of the Periodic Table. Generally, Yttrium in its pure form is relatively stable when exposed to air. This is so because the element creates a protective oxidation coating when in contact with air. The element has only one stable isotope – Y-89 which is also its only naturally occurring isotope. Yttrium is found in certain types of uranium ore. Geologically, this is the earth’s twenty eight most abundant element. It is interesting to note that rock samples brought from the moon by the Apollo mission contain a relatively high amount of Yttrium. The story of Yttrium begins in the Swedish village of Ytterby, at the local quarry to be precise. In the late 1700s, retired army officer and enthusiast chemist Carl Arrhenius stumbled across a heavy black rock at the local quarry. He thought the piece of rock contained the newly discovered tungsten element and sent the rock for analysis to a number of chemists around the country. The rock sample reached a Finnish chemist by the name of Johan Gadolin from the University of Abo. He carefully ran tests on the rock and found out that it was in fact not tungsten, but a new oxide or ‘earth’ as it was referred to in those days. The Finnish chemist’s complete analysis on the element was officially published in 1794. Although Yttrium as an element was identified in the years to come, it was not isolated as an element until 1828, by Friedrich Wohler.Yttrium as an element is not too widely used in modern times, however, some of its chemical compounds are. For example, Yttrium oxide and Yttrium orthovanadate are combined with a chemical element known as europium in order to produce red phosphor which is used to create the color red in (CRT & LED) televisions. Garnets produced from Yttrium and iron are widely used in microwave communications in order to shield equipment from actual microwaves. Garnets made using Yttrium and aluminium usually imitate diamonds in jewellery pieces. The element also sees use in manufacturing of superconductors, electronic filters, electrodes, and electrolytes, it also has certain medical applications. There are no known biological uses for Yttrium, but prolonged exposure to the element can cause lung disease in humans, even though certain organs and tissues do contain small amounts of Yttrium."
40,Zirconium,Zr,91.22,"Zirconium  (atomic number 40, symbol Zr) is a transition metal that was first isolated in 1824 by Jons Berzelius. This chemical element was discovered in 1789 by the German chemist Martin Klaproth who also discovered cerium and uranium.This element is a metal with a hexagonal close-packed structure and shares properties with titanium. It is lustrous, ductile, malleable, and silvery-gray in color. It is a strong metal that is corrosion and heat resistant. Zirconium has a boiling point of 7952 F (4400 C) and melting point of 3365 F (1852 C). Four stable isotopes are included in the composition of zirconium – Zr-94, Zr-92, Zr-91, and Zr-90. There are also metastable isomers such as Zr-91m, Ze-90m2, Zr-90m1, and others. The element does not react with alkalis and acids but forms compounds such as carbides, nitrides, oxides, and others. Common oxidation states include 1, 4, 2, and 3. The element is found in different countries, including the U.S., South Africa, Russia, India, Brazil, and Australia. The major deposits are found in South Africa and Australia. There are significant deposits of zirconia and zircon in Sri Lanka, India, the U.S, and other countries.  The metal occurs in many minerals, including kosnarite, baddeleyite, and others.  Baddeleyite deposits are found in Brazil. Zirconium is also isolated from minerals such as rutile and ilmenite. The total reserves are estimated at over 1 billion tonnes. Zirconium has different applications and is added to furnace bricks, percussion caps, and catalytic converters. There are other applications of zirconium and its compounds. The element is used in TVs, surgical instruments, and flashbulbs in photography. It is used in jewelry, ceramic opacification, and refractories. Zirconium dioxide or cubic zirconia is widely used as a low-cost alternative to gemstones, including diamonds. The metal is also used in the aeronautic and space industries while compounds containing yttria and zirconia are used to make gas turbines, vanes and blades, and combustors. Alloys are also used to manufacture heat exchangers, fittings, pipes, and other components and items. Superconducting magnets also contain zirconium, and it is also used to produce surgical instruments. When alloyed with zinc, it has magnetic properties. The element has applications in the packaging industry because it is strong and water-resistant. Zirconium-based catalysts have applications in different reactions, including oxidation, isomerization, hydrogenation, and amination. Zirconium is a fairly common element and is more abundant than lead, zinc, and copper. It is not considered an environmental hazard. Only 30 percent of the plants tested contain zirconium, but aquatic plants absorb it more rapidly. Most compounds are inert and insoluble, but cases of pulmonary granuloma or lung lesions have been reported among zirconium workers. Acute side effects  include eye and skin irritations and irritations of the throat, nose, mucous membranes, and the respiratory tract. Chronic exposure may cause dermatitis and pulmonary edema. The respiratory tract is also affected. Persons handling zirconium compounds wear rubber gloves."

42,Molybdenum,Mo,95.94,"Molybdenum  (atomic number 42, symbol Mo) is a chemical element and a silvery metal, which readily forms stable, hard carbides. It has the 6th highest melting point of all elements and is often used in steel alloys. The element occurs in minerals in different oxidation states and is not found as a free metal in nature. Minerals containing molybdenum have been known for a long time, but the element itself was discovered in 1778 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. In 1781, Peter Jacob Hjelm isolated the element using linseed oil and carbon. Molybdenum had no industrial application for about a century due to the immaturity of metallurgical techniques, difficulty extracting the metal in pure form, and its relative scarcity. In its pure form, the element has a Mohs hardness of 5.5 and is silvery-white in color. Molybdenum has a melting point of 4,753 °F (2,623 °C), and of all elements occurring in nature, only carbon, tungsten, rhenium, osmium, and tantalum have higher melting points. The metal has 35 known isotopes ad 4 nuclear isomers. The isotopes range from 83 to 117 in atomic mass and 7 of them occur naturally. The only unstable, naturally occurring isotope of molybdenum is molybdenum-100. The unstable isotopes of this element decay into ruthenium, technetium, and niobium isotopes. The largest global producers of molybdenum are Peru, the United States, Chile, China, and Canada. Molybdenite is the major commercial source of this metal although it is found in powellite, wulfenite, and other minerals. The metal is both recovered as a byproduct of tungsten and copper mining and extracted as a principal ore. Molybdenite is the main product of large mines in British Columbia and Colorado while it is the byproduct of copper mining in northern Chile and Utah. Given that the element has a high melting point, it is used in the manufacturing of electrically-heated glass furnaces. It is also used in the production of some electrical filaments, aircraft and missile parts as well as in the nuclear power industry. Petroleum refining also uses the metal as a catalyst. In addition, molybdenum powders are used in the production of circuit inks. One of the main applications of molybdenum is as an alloying agent for steel. Molybdenum is added in concentrations up to 8 percent to form high-strength alloys. Molybdenum also forms corrosion and heat resistant materials when alloyed with nickel, and these have application in the chemical industry. One of the element’s compounds, molybdenum disulphide is used as a high-temperature lubricant. Another compound of molybdenum, molybdenum trioxide helps adhere enamels to metals. There are other compounds of molybdenum as well, including molybdenum phosphide, molybdenum hexafluoride, and molybdic acid. Different animal experiments have shown that the element and its compounds are very toxic. Workers who were chronically exposed to molybdenum in a Soviet Mo-Cu plant had liver dysfunction with hyperbilirubinemia. Inhabitants and factory workers in some molybdenum-rich regions of Armenia had signs of gout, with the main symptoms being erythema, articular deformities, joint pain in the feet, hands, and knees, and edema of the joint areas. While the element is vital for all species, it is very toxic in larger amounts. In comparison to other micronutrients in the soil, molybdenum is more soluble in alkaline soils and less soluble in acidic ones. As a result, its availability to plant species depends on drainage conditions and pH. "
43,Technetium,Tc,98,"Technetium This metal has a hexagonal close-packed structure and is paramagnetic. Common oxidation states include +7, +5, and +4. The element reacts with sulfuric acid, nitric acid, and aqua regia. It is radioactive, silvery grey in color, and has no stable isotopes. There are 9 isotopes, including Tc-100, Tc-99m, Tc-99, Tc-98, Tc-95, and others. Tc-100, for example, has a half life of about 14 minutes while Tc-95 has a half life of 20 hours. This is a d-block element with relatively high boiling and melting points of 4877 oC and 2157 oC, respectively. It forms carbides, tellurides, selenides, sulfides, oxides, and other compounds. This element is artificially produced but small amounts are found in the Earth’s crust, mainly in uranium ores. However, significant amounts have been produced in nuclear reactors. Te-99m is found in different sites, including hospitals, laboratories, universities, fuel cycle facilities, and nuclear reactors. In the universe, the metal is found in N-, M-, and S-type stars. One of the isotopes, Tc-99m is used to treat circulatory system diseases. It is used in combination with a tin compound in post-heart attack treatments. Te-99m is mainly used for research and medical purposes, for example, to assess the condition of internal organs such as the spleen, liver, lungs, kidneys, and heart. Patients with a history of diabetes, kidney and liver disease, Te-99m is among the most commonly used radioisotopes. Tc-99 can be used in nuclear batteries as well. The element is also catalyst similar to elements such as palladium and rhenium. While there are many possible uses, one problem is that technetium is radioactive. Tc-99 is considered a health hazard and must be handled with care. It is released in the environment through airborne emissions, nuclear weapons, facilities used to store radioactive materials, and the processing of nuclear fuel. Higher concentrations are reported near weapons facilities. The isotope is found in rock sediments, animal and plant species, soils, air, and water. Te-99 is found in high concentrations in some aquatic species such as brown algae. Technetium also contributes to environmental pollution because considerable quantities are produced through the fission of uranium and uranium-235 in particular. It forms solid, liquid, and airborne waste with a long half life of about 220,000 years. In contrast, the half life of Tc-99m is only 6 hours. Radiation exposure increases the risk for leukemia and bone cancer, and young patients are at a higher risk than older ones. At the same time, Tc-99m is safer to use compared to other radioactive isotopes. Side effects such as dizziness, confusion, discomfort, chest pain, and blurred vision require medical attention. Radiation exposure is also associated with side effects such as joint inflammation, vomiting, nausea, gait abnormality, and other skeletal, heart, and gastrointestinal problems. Te-99 enters the body through contaminated water and food and is accumulated in the gastrointestinal tract and the thyroid gland. "
44,Ruthenium,Ru,101.07,"Ruthenium  (number 44, symbol Ru) is a transition metal that belongs to the platinum group metals together with iridium, osmium, and rhodium. It was discovered and isolated by the Polish chemist and physician Andrew Sniadecki in 1807. Ruthenium is a rare metal that is mainly found in deposits of other platinum group metals. There are deposits in South Africa, Canada, and the Ural Mountains. Iridium, rhodium, ruthenium, and osmium are separated from base metals and gold. It is also extracted from the iron-nickel sulfide pentlandite. The metal is also found in ruthenarsenite, ruarsite, laurite, and other minerals, but they are rare. This element has a hexagonal close-packed structure and is white in color. It is a hard metal with many oxidation states, but +4, +3, and +2 are the most common ones. The metal also forms compounds such as ruthenides and oxides. The most stable radioisotope is ruthenium-106, and there are 34 radioisotopes in total. Most have a very short half life of less than 5 minutes. The element itself is made up of several isotopes, including Ru-104, Ru-102, Ru-101, and Ru-100. Ru-102 is the most common one. The metal does not react with acids, water, and air. The element is added to palladium and platinum to produce electrical contacts. Manufacturers also use compounds such as bismuth and lead ruthenates and ruthenium dioxide to make chip resistors. Some complexes and isotopes have industrial applications and are used for medical purposes. Ru-106, for example, is used in the treatment of eye tumors. Iodine-125 is also used. Ru-106 is more commonly used, however, because it causes less damage to the eye. It can be combined with iodine-125, cobalt-60, or other isotopes for therapeutic purposes. Or it can be used in combination with therapies such as transpupillary thermotherapy and local resection. Ru-106 is usually combined with gamma-emitting isotopes for eye cancer treatment. The metal is also added to alloys with tungsten, nickel, molybdenum, and cobalt. Its compounds have applications in the glass and ceramics industries. In addition to alloys, the metal is used in the chemical and electronics industries, for example, in anodes. Ruthenium is also a catalyst in pharmaceutical and organic chemistry. The production of ethanol acid and ammonia involves ruthenium as well. The metal has potential to be used in sun-powered technologies and systems. Some of its compounds absorb light and can be used in place of conventional technologies. One compound, ruthenium(VIII) oxide has applications in the electronics industry and is used to make potentiometers, resistors, and other parts and components. Its compounds have carcinogenic properties and are found to be toxic. One of its compounds, ruthenium oxide is a health hazard because it is volatile and very toxic. Ruthenium can enter the body through ingestion, and it is suggested that the metal is deposited in the bones. Ruthenium tetroxide should be avoided because it is unstable and poisonous. It is handled in hood because the fumes are toxic and can irritate the lungs, throat, mouth, eyes, and skin. The compound explodes at temperatures above 106 °C (222.8 °F) and reacts with sulfur, cellulose, ethanol, charcoal, and hydriodic acid. Violent and explosive reactions occur with compounds such as phosphorus tribromide and ammonia. While handling, it is important to wear face and eye protection as well as gloves and protective clothing. Radionuclides such as Ru-106 are also harmful for human health because they increase the risk for cancer. With a half life of 373 days, Ru-106 has been used to test nuclear weapons. It was isolated in 1844 by K.K. Klaus."
45,Rhodium,Rh,102.905,"Rhodium This is a rare precious metal that is found in ores together with gold, platinum, silver, and palladium. At temperatures of up to 600°C (1,112 °F), water and air have no effect on rhodium. It reacts with molten alkalis and concentrated sulfuric acid. The metal has radioisotopes and isotopes, and the most stable ones are rhodium-102 and rhodium-101. The isotopes are 9 in total. Many of the radioisotopes have a short half life of less than 30 minutes. The metal itself has several oxidation states, but the most commonly observed is +3. Rhodium has different industrial and commercial applications and is often used in alloys with iridium and platinum. Alloys are used to make products such as resistance and thermocouple wires, photograph needles, and pen nibs. In addition, alloys are used for the production of electrodes and furnace windings. Electrodes are also used for electrical contacts and spark plugs. Rhodium itself is used to control emissions and in the process of hydrogenation. Alloyed with other metals, it is incorporated in turbine engines, lab crucibles, and bushings. Optical instruments are also produced with the use of rhodium. In general, the element has many applications because it is resistant to corrosion, reflective, and can be alloyed with other metals. In addition, rhodium has good oxidation resistance. It is also used in alloys because it is very durable.The element obtained from nickel and copper ores, which makes it a by-product. It is found in very low concentrations of up to 0.1 percent. During extraction, platinum, palladium, gold, and silver are removed to obtain rhodium. The process is complex and involves treatment with hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide, and sodium bisulphate. It is also treated with ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite. Burning and evaporation are required to obtain rhodium in pure form. In general, the extraction process is more complex due to the fact that it is found together with other precious metals. There are mining sites in Canada, South Africa, and other countries.  There are deposits in Montana, the U.S. as well. Rhodium is mainly exported by Russia and South Africa, with a total production of 30 tonnes per year. It is more expensive than other precious metals such as gold. One risk to consider is that rhodium is flammable and is thus considered a fire hazard. It reacts with oxygen in the air. Airborne particles at high concentrations are harmful for human health. There is insufficient research to conclude whether exposure to rhodium and its isotopes is a health hazard, however. Given its scarcity, the element is not considered an environmental hazard. Laboratory tests on plants show that it is toxic in high concentrations. Its compounds are reactive, but the metal itself is harmless. In fact, some compounds have been found to be carcinogenic, but rhodium is a non-toxic material. "
46,Palladium,Pd,106.4,"Palladium Palladium (atomic number 46, chemical symbol Pd) is a ductile and soft metal with a lustrous sheen. Other elements in the platinum group include osmium, iridium, and palladium. It is an element of low toxicity and is resistant to corrosion.  The metal was discovered in 1803 by the English physicist and chemist William Wollaston. Today, it is found in South and North America, Ethiopia, Russia, Brazil, and Australia. Palladium is also found in copper and nickel deposits on the territory of South Africa and Canada. Most of the palladium is in the form of byproduct from nickel refining. Palladium has the lowest density and lowest melting point of all PGMs. The element resembles platinum in color and softness. It is ductile and soft when subjected to heat treatment, but its strength increases when cold-worked. Palladium reacts with and dissolves slowly in hydrochloric, nitric, and sulfuric acid. It does not tarnish at normal temperatures but tarnishes in moist environments that contain sulfur. The element is attacked by both sulfuric acid and nitric acid. The metal is found in nickel-copper deposits and with other elements from the platinum group metals. It is mainly a byproduct from nickel refining, but some minerals have been found to be rich in palladium. The metal is extracted from nickel and copper deposits and deposits of other platinum group metals. These are found in South and North America, Ethiopia, Russia, Brazil, and Australia. The copper and nickel deposits are mainly in South Africa and Canada.  Palladium has valance of 2, 3, or 4. Its boiling point is 2970 °C and its melting point – 1554 °C. Extraction is a complex process because palladium is mixed with platinum and other metals in ores. In some cases, the main focus of operations is the extraction of palladium or platinum, but it may be a byproduct. The base metal byproduct or ore is treated with a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, known as aqua regia. A solution that contains H2PdCl4, platinum, and gold is formed. Palladium is used to manufacture watches, electrical contacts, and surgical instruments. The element is also used in photography and technology. Ceramic capacitors, watch springs, and connector platings are also made using palladium. The element forms palladium hydroxide at room temperature and absorbs hydrogen. Thus it is used for hydrogen storage. Moreover, palladium has a higher absorption capacity than other transition metals and high x values should be reached before it loses ductility. The metal is also used as an alloying agent and in different dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes as it acts as a catalyst. Palladium compounds are used as catalysts for carbon-carbon bond forming. Primary alcohols are oxidized in alkaline media by using palladium as an electrocatalyst. In addition, carbon monoxide detectors use palladium dichloride which absorbs carbon monoxide. Exposure may cause vomiting, skin sensitivity, and irritation of the respiratory tract and the eyes. While palladium has a low toxicity, its compounds are considered carcinogenic and very toxic. Palladium chloride has been shown to cause kidney, liver, and bone marrow damage in laboratory conditions. The compound is dangerous and toxic when absorbed through skin, inhaled, or ingested. Most plant species tolerate low levels of palladium, but some are killed by it. The growth rate of plants may be affected above certain level."
47,Silver,Ag,107.87,"Silver Deposits are found in different parts of the world, including countries such as Canada, Honduras, Bolivia, Mexico, Germany, and Norway. The major producers are the United States and Poland. The annual production is about 7,000 tonnes. High concentrations are found in sewage outfalls, metal mining, cloud seeding, and waste sites. Species living near mine wastes and electroplating plants are found to have higher concentrations of silver. It is also found in a variety of non-biological sources. Low concentrations are found in natural sources as well.  The element has several isotopes, including Ag-111, Ag-110, Ag-109, Ag-107, and others. There are 11 known isotopes. Some have a half life of about 25 seconds, others – of over 130 years, and still others are stable. The element has high thermal and electrical conductivity and is malleable and ductile. In fact, this metal has the highest electrical conductivity.  It is stable in water and air and has a metallic luster. Silver tarnishes in contact with hydrogen sulfide and ozone. The boiling point is 2,212 °C (4,013.6 °F) and the melting point is 962 °C (1763.6 °F). While silver is not chemically active, it reacts with sulfuric acid and nitric acid. There are sulfides, fluorides, and oxides, as well as explosive compounds such as silver fulminate which is sensitive to pressure and heat. The metal itself is stable in water. Silver and its compounds have many commercial applications. It is used to make silverware and jewelry, including ornaments, pendants, and earrings. Silver is also used in the electronic, electrical, photographic, and other industries. Silver electrical contacts are used to manufacture keyboards. Printed circuits contain silver-based paints. The metal is also used to make batteries, contacts, brazing and dental alloys, and mirrors. It has applications in the clothing industry, medicine, and optics.  It is also used to produce endotracheal breathing tubes and urinary catheters as well as for its antimicrobial properties. E174 which is a food additive also contains silver and is added to cookie decorations and coatings. While silver is non-toxic and is not considered a health hazard, its compounds are poisonous. Exposure increases the risk for argyria which causes blue skin discoloration. Miners, silver metal workers, and patients who take silver-based supplements are at risk especially after long-term exposure. Exposure usually occurs through inhalation, ingestion, and skin contact. Depending on the concentration, soluble salts can be lethal. Inhalation of silver salts can cause coma, confusion, staggering, and drowsiness. Side effects include respiratory problems, headache, and breathing difficulty. In laboratory settings, exposure results in brain, liver, and lung damage, eye and kidney damage, and anemia. Research suggests that chronic exposure may lead to nervous system damage and cardiovascular problems. In species, the highest concentrations are found in the kidneys, the digestive gland, and other internal organs. Concentrations in living organisms vary based on factors such as compounds found in water, the biosphere, salinity, water temperature, metabolism, and health. Other factors include reproductive stage, sex, size, and age. Some studies suggest that silver may be a carcinogen, and the metal does not have a biological role."
48,Cadmium,Cd,112.41,"Cadmium  is a chemical element similar to mercury and zinc, which are stable metals. It is a blue-white, soft metal similar to mercury in that it has a lower melting point than the group of transition metals. Being a soft metal, cadmium can be cut with a knife, and is soluble in acids. However, it is not soluble in alkalis and tarnishes in air.  Because cadmium does not have partly filled f or d electron shells in common oxidation or elemental states, it is not considered a transition metal in every case. In the Earth’s crust, cadmium is found in concentrations of 0.1 – 0.5 ppm. Cadmium is a byproduct of zinc extraction, occurring as a component of many zinc ores. It is a rare element compared to zinc and also occurs as a byproduct of copper and lead extraction. After application, it is present in the environment because cadmium is found in pesticides and manures. A large amount of cadmium is released every year or some 25,000 tons. Half of it is released through weathering rocks into the rivers and some through volcanoes and forest fires into the air. Cadmium is also released through manufacturing and other human activities. Because sufficient quantities of cadmium are produced as a byproduct, cadmium ores are not explored. The mining sites are those where zinc is extracted, and the smelting of this metallic element from sphelerite, which is its ore, produces cadmium as a byproduct. The main producers of cadmium are Canada, the United States, Japan, Mexico, Australia, and Peru. Cadmium can enter the body through food, which is rich in cadmium and increases its concentration in the body. Foods that are rich in it are mussels, shellfish, cocoa powder, mushrooms, liver, and dried seaweed. People who smoke are exposed to higher levels of cadmium. The blood stream transports cadmium to other parts of the body, augmenting the effects of cadmium already supplied with cadmium-rich food. In terms of applications, cadmium is mostly used in the production of Ni-Cd batteries as well as stabilizers for plastics, plating and coatings, and pigments. Another application of the element is in electroplating steel, with cadmium film providing a good protection against the sea. It is also used as a barrier for controlling nuclear fission because of its ability to absorb neutrons.Cadmium oxide is a compound used in the production of green and blue phosphors for picture tubes in color television and phosphors in black and white television. Cadmium sulfide is another compound used as a photoconductive coating in the production of photocopier drums. The element forms different salts in paint pigments, including CdS, which is the most common. Cadmium selenide is a pigment known as cadmium red. Cadmium reds, oranges, and yellows are used by painters working with this pigment. The colors are considerably toned down during production before they are blended into acrylics, gouaches, and other pigments and paint formulations. In higher organisms, the element has no known beneficial role. It has been discovered recently that cadmium plays role in lower life forms. A cadmium-dependent carbonate dehydratases has been observed in marine diatoms, through which a group of enzymes are formed. They act to catalyze the interconversion of water and carbon dioxide to protons and bicarbonate.  "
49,Indium,In,114.82,"Indium  is a malleable and soft chemical element, which is similar to thallium and gallium in terms of chemical properties. It is a rare and fusible metal and exhibits intermediary properties between gallium and thallium. The primary source of indium is zinc ores, and it occurs in a compound form in them. Indium rarely occurs in the form of grains of a free or native metal, and these grains are of no commercial importance. The element does not react with water, but strong oxidizing agents oxidize it, for example, oxalic acid and halogens, giving indium (III) compounds. Indium does not react with carbon, silicon, or boron, and the corresponding carbide, silicide, and boride are not known. No reaction takes place between hydrogen and indium, but indium (III) and indium (I) hydrates can be formed. Indium has a face-centered tetragonal structure. It dissolvers in acids and is stable in water and air. It burns with a violet flame when it is heated about its melting point. The main application of indium is in producing transparent electrodes in touch screens and liquid crystal displays. Indium is also used to create lubricated layers in thin-films and during the Second World War, it was employed to coat bearings in aircraft. In addition, indium is used to create low melting point alloys, being an element of some lead-free solders. Both gallium and indium can wet glass. Indium is added to fusible, low-melting alloys and serves as a protective plate for metal surfaces like bearings. Indium is also employed in the forming of corrosion-resistant mirror surfaces. When it evaporates and deposits on glass, indium produces good quality mirror, which is as good as that of silver. Then, indium foils are employed as part of an assessment process to establish what takes place inside nuclear reactors. In low-pressure sodium vapor lamps, indium is employed as a light filter. Indium tin oxide and indium oxide are applied to glass substrates as a conductive coating as to make electroluminescent panels. Some compounds of indium, for example, indium nitride, indium phosphide, and indium antimonide are semiconductors and have useful properties. Indium is also employed in laser diodes and light-emitting diodes, which are based on semiconductors like InGaP, and InGaN. MOVPE or Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy is used to produce them. The synthesis of CIGS also employs indium, which is involved in the manufacturing of thin film solar cells. High purity trimethylindium, which is a very pure metalorganics of indium, is used in the making of compound semiconductors. In alkaline batteries, it is a substitute for mercury, preventing zinc from releasing hydrogen gas and corroding. Indium does not have any biological role. According to scientists, it may stimulate metabolism in small doses. People rarely encounter compounds of indium, but they are very toxic and can damage the liver, kidney, and heart, and may be teratogenic. Research has not produced sufficient data on the effects of indium on human health. It should be approached with utmost caution. The element does not occur widely in the environment and hence, it poses no threat to marine or land life. However, the environmental effect of indium has not been sufficiently investigated. Cultivated soils have been found to be richer in this element compared with non-cultivated ones. Discovered in 1863 by Reich and Richter. "
50,Tin,Sn,118.71,"Tin  (atomic number 50, symbol Sn) is a metal and chemical element which is known since ancient times. Copper and tin were combined to produce bronze as early as 3000 BC. Tin is ductile, malleable, and silvery-white in color and occurs in two allotropic forms. The element is pliable and soft and reacts with acid salts, alkalis, and strong acids. Tin has good corrosion resistance and is used as a catalyst. It has a boiling point of (4118 F) 2270 C and melting point of 450 F (232 C). There are 20 isotopes and 10 of them are stable. The element has a diamond cubic structure and forms different compounds, including organotin compounds, hydrides, and inorganic compounds such as tin tetraiodide, tin tetrabromide, and other halide compounds. Tin is solid at room temperature. The two oxidation states are + 4 and +2. Gray tin has few commercial applications. Tin, however, is widely used because the element is not affected by bases, acids, water, oxygen, and air.  The element forms alloys that have various commercial applications and is used as solder for dental amalgams, joining electric circuits and pipes, babbitt metal, bell metal, and pewter.  Babbitt metal contains different metals, including tin, lead, cadmium, and arsenic. This is an alloy that is used to make industrial equipment. Tin oxide is a compound that is used in gas sensors and the ceramic industry. Tin is also used to produce electronic equipment such as smartphones, tablets, iPads, and others. Solder and pewter are produced by combining lead and tin. Superconductive wires are manufactured by alloying niobium and tin. Specialized alloys also contain tin combined with zirconium, lead, and copper. Alloys made from lead and tin, for example, are used in pipe organs. Other alloys such as bronze are used to make valves, water gauges, electrical devices, wires, and springs.The element can be extracted from different sulfides, including teallite, canfieldite, franckeite, cylindrite, tannite, and others. The major mining sites are found in countries such as Indonesia, Malaya, Laos, Thailand, and China. The East Asian and Bolivian tin belt are rich in deposits. The major producers include Peru, Indonesia, Bolivia, Congo, Russia, Belgium, Thailand, and others. Indonesia is the world’s largest tin producer by volume. Given that tin is mined and available commercially, it is rarely produced in lab settings. Exposure can lead to shortness of breath, severe sweating, and dizziness. Other side effects include stomach aches, headaches, and skin and eye irritation. Long-term exposure results in brain damage, weak immune system, liver damage, depression, sleeping disorders, and chromosomal damage. Organic tin pollutes the environment and is toxic to phytoplankton, fungi, fish, and other species. Exposure affects reproduction and growth. One problem with tin is that it is not easily biodegradable and can take a long time. It is found in water systems and soils and remains there for decades."
51,Antimony,Sb,121.76,"Antimony  (Sb, atomic number 51) is a toxic chemical element. It is classed among the group of metalloids. Metalloids are elements that are neither purely metal nor non-metal. Other metalloids include boron, silicon, germanium, arsenic, and tellurium. The status of polonium is disputed, although this element is often classed among the metalloids as well. The use of antimony is limited owing to its excessive toxic properties. The compounds of this element, however, have proven of great use in terms of chemical developments. They serve to reduce the flammability of fuels and postpone combustion, which is why they are important fire retardants and are used in many commercial products for industrial and domestic use. Antimony is increasingly being used in microelectronics. A compound of antimony, antimony (III) sulfide, was known to man as far back as 3000 BC. It is not known who discovered it, however. Pieces of a vase dating to this time period were found on the territory of what is Iraq today. A copper object plated with this element was found in Egypt as well. These discoveries testify to the early use of antimony. Some scientists dispute that what was found is indeed antimony because the metal is very brittle. Others counter that what was found was natural antimony, which has different properties. The truth of the matter is unknown as of yet. There is more information about the etymology of antimony. It comes from antimoine in French, which means monk-killer or anti-monk. Most of the early chemists and scientists were monks, and many perished in view of the element’s highly toxic properties. There is also a word in Greek, antimonos, which means “against one”. This is taken to mean “not observed in metal”.  There are two isotopes of antimony - 123Sb with a natural abundance of close to 43 percent and 121Sb with a natural abundance of over 57 percent. The longest-lived of its 35 radioisotopes is 125Sb with a half-life of 2.75 years. There are three types of compounds of antimony – halides, oxides and hydroxides, and hydrides, antimonides, and organoantimony compounds. The latter are usually prepared by combining Grinard reagents with antimony halides. A number of compounds are known with Sb (V) and Sb (III) centers such as cations, anions, and chloro-organic derivatives. Antimonides are formed with metals, including silver antimonide and indium antimonide. As mentioned, this element is mainly applied in the manufacturing of flame-proofing compounds. Possible markets for such products include kids’ toys and clothes, aircraft, and automobile seat covers. Antimony is added to polyester resins to manufacture light aircraft engine covers. It also has a multitude of uses in the fiberglass composites industry.  Antimony is fused with lead and the resulting alloy (solid solution) is used in lead-acid batteries. Other alloys incorporating the element are used to make bullets, cable sheaths, solder, and even organ pipes. When used in alloys, antimony serves to increase the mechanical strength and hardness. In the semiconductor industry, it is used to manufacture diodes, hall-effect devices, and infrared detectors. There are also some medical uses of antimony. One use is as hydrated potassium antimonyl antimonate (tartar emetic). In addition, antimony is used in the production of enamels and colorings in ceramics and pottery. The manufacture of semiconductors in the electronic industry makes use of antimony as well. "
52,Tellurium,Te,127.6,"Tellurium Tellurium is doped with metals such as silver, gold, tin, and copper. Common oxidation states are -2, +4, and +6, and there are five stable isotopes – Te-126, Te-125, Te-124, Te-123, and Te-122. The boiling point is 1390 °C (2534 °F) and the melting point - 450 °C (842 °F). This element is brittle, with a hexagonal crystal structure and metallic luster. The element belongs to the chalcogens family or oxygen group and forms oxocompounds, halides, polytellurides, tellurides, and organotellurium compounds. Potassium telluride is an odorless solid with a white color while hydrogen telluride is a colorless gas. Sodium telluride is an odorless solid that is white in color. While the element occurs in nature, it is usually obtained as a byproduct of copper extraction and refining. It also occurs in minerals, including krennerite, calaverite, and sylvanite, and there are tellurium-containing minerals such as tellurate and tellurite. Sylvanite and calverite, for example, are tellurides of gold. Bismuthide maldonite and antimonide aurostibite contain tellurium and gold. Sulfide minerals contain very small amounts. The total annual production amounts to 220 tonnes. Japan, Peru, Canada, and the United States are the main producers. The element is added to tin, lead, and aluminum alloys for better resistance, strength, and durability. It is also used to produce glasses, solar devices, ceramics, and cast iron. Tellurium has applications in the electronic, semiconductor, and This element is teratogenic and toxic and must be handled with caution. When inhaled, it can cause side effects such as nausea, garlic odor, and headache. Other side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, and even poisoning in extreme cases. Long-term exposure leads to vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, respiratory problems, and eye irritation. Other side effects include garlic-like breath and liver problems. Toxic fumes are released when heated. There are radioactive isotopes as well. Tellurium is produced commercially. It is not considered an environmental hazard and plays no biological role. Exposure to sodium, potassium, and hydrogen telluride can cause nausea, loss of appetite, and insomnia. Other side effects include metallic taste, dry mouth, and loss of the sweat function. Tellurium hydroxide is a very toxic compound. Long-term exposure is associated with a reduced volume of red blood cells. Long-term exposure is not recommended for persons with skin disease, chronic respiratory problems, blood disorders, and neurological disorders. In laboratory conditions, intoxication causes coma, convulsions, paralysis, and tremors in animals. Note that the compounds of the element are more toxic than tellurium itself. Iron foundry workers report symptoms such as nausea, anorexia, metallic taste, and dryness in the mouth. "
53,Iodine,I,126.904,"Iodine  is a chemical element with low toxicity, which dissolves easily in chloroform, hexane, and other organic solvents due to its lack of polarity. The color of iodine solutions depends on the solvent and its polarity. Solutions are violet in color in hexane and other non-polar solvents and dark crimson in moderately polar ones. Solutions are brown or orange in strongly polar solvents, for example, ethanol and acetone. When iodine is dissolved in carbon disulphide, carbon tetrachloride, or chloroform, it yields purple-colored solutions. Iodine is slightly soluble in water and gives a yellow solution. This element is shiny, blue-black, nonmetallic solid, volatizing into a violet-blue gas at room temperature. It has an irritating odor as well. Iodine is less reactive compared to other halogens and forms compounds with different elements. Iodine also exhibits some properties characteristic of metals. It binds to starch, coloring it dark blue. Iodine was discovered in 1811 by Bernard Courtois who gave samples to Nicolas Clement and Charles Desormes to continue research. At a meeting of the Imperial Institute, Clement and Courtois described the new substance. Iodine has 37 isotopes but only one of them is stable (127I). The half-life of one of its longest lived radioisotopes, 129I is 15.7 million years. The next longest-lived radioisotope of iodine is iodine-125, but its half-life is only 59 days. This isotope is used in some imaging tests in nuclear medicine, in brachytherapy implanted capsules, and as a gamma-emitting tag. Iodine has multiple applications as well. It is used for water treatment, as a disinfectant, and as a radiocontrast agent. There are special applications of inorganic iodides. Titanium, zirconium, and hafnium are purified by using the van Arkel Process. Then, the main component of photographic film is silver iodide, while cloud seeding consumes thousands of kilograms of the compound a year. Some disorders of the thyroid gland are treated by using iodine-131, which is a radioactive isotope of the element. This element is found in seaweeds and seawater as well as in nitrate bearing earth, Chilean saltpeter, brines from sea deposits, and brackish waters from oil wells and salt wells. The reaction between copper sulfate and potassium iodide produces ultrapure iodine. Iodine is very important for proper nutrition, but handling it requires caution. Lesions are caused by skin contact, and the vapor irritates the mucous membranes and the eyes. In animal biology, the main role of iodine is as a component of the thyroid hormones T3 or triiodothyronine and T4 or thyroxine. These hormones are produced from tyrosine’s condensation products and are deposited before the release of thyroglobulin, which is an iodine-containing protein. Iodide is absorbed from the blood by the thyroid gland so that these hormones are released into the blood stream. Another hormone (TSH) regulates these actions, and it is produced by the pituitary. Most multicellular organisms synthesize thyroid hormones and they have an effect on some unicellular organisms as well.  Iodine is the main component of thyroid hormones, which are essential for metabolism, the nervous system, and growth. Iodine shortages are experienced by persons who eat no or little bread. The thyroid gland’s function slows down, and it swells up. The intake of large quantities is dangerous and can affect all organs in the body, causing loss of weight and disturbed heartbeats. "
54,Xenon,Xe,131.3,"Xenon (atomic number 54, symbol Xe) is a gas and chemical element that was first isolated in 1898 by the English chemist Morris Travers and the Scottish chemist William Ramsay. Ramsey also discovered the elements krypton and neon. This is a noble gas which is tasteless, colorless, and odorless. It is a nonmetal and gas at room temperature. It forms compounds such as xenon hexafluoroplatinate and dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate. Over 80 xenon compounds have been studied. It reacts with platinum, oxygen, and fluorine to form compounds. Different compounds are formed when xenon reacts with fluorine, including xenon tetrafluoride and difluoride.  The gas forms compounds such as oxohalides, oxides, halides, and others. Several fluorides have been studied, including xenon difluoride, xenon hexafluoride, and others. This element is a trace gas with a face-centered cubic structure which is composed of 8 stable isotopes. The unstable isotopes are over 40 in number. Neutron irradiation is used to produce Xe-135, Xe-133, and other radioactive isotopes. The boiling point is -162 °F (-108 °C) and the melting point is -169 °F (-111 °C). The most common oxidation states are +8, +6, +4, +2, +1, and 0. Some mineral springs release gases that contain xenon. It is also found in comets, asteroids, and the Earth’s atmosphere. The gas can be obtained through fractional distillation and separation techniques. There are few commercial applications of xenon, which is added to road markings and signs. It is also used in high-pressure and motion picture projection lamps, high-intensity arc lamps, and stroboscopic and photographic lamps. Xenon is used in lasers, projectors, solar simulators, and bactericidal lamps. There are other applications, including medical and commercial. Radioisotopes are used in imaging technologies such as tomography and gamma emission to image major organs such as the brain, lungs, and heart and to measure the blood flow. Xe-133 is an isotope for diagnostic use because it tends to concentrate in protein and water solutions, plasma, and blood.  The gas is also used as general anesthetic in medicine. In addition to these applications, xenon is used in paint testers, bubble chambers, ultraviolet lamps, and electronic flashes. Exposure through inhalation may cause side effects such as loss of consciousness, vomiting, nausea, dizziness, deep coma, and even death. The symptoms include fatigue, emotional instability, air hunger, convulsions, and nausea. Concentrations of 75 percent and higher can be fatal. Xenon does not have carcinogenic properties. In normal concentrations, this element is chemically inert, non-toxic, and safe unless inhaled in high concentrations. Proper disposal of residual gas is required.  Gas is usually stored in metal or sealed glass containers. Keeping xenon in rubber or plastic containers is unsafe. Oxygen compounds are considered a health hazard because they are toxic. In general, compounds should be handled with caution to limit radiation exposure. Some of its compounds, such as Xe-133 are unsafe for expectant mothers and can cause infertility."
55,Caesium,Cs,132.90545,"Caesium  is a an alkali metal with a silvery-gold color and the only liquid metal from the group of elemental metals, which is liquid near or at room temperature. The only other metals in a liquid form at/ around room temperature are mercury and gallium. Caesium has chemical and physical properties that resemble those of potassium and rubidium. It is pyrophoric and very reactive, and reacts with water at temperature of 177 F (116 C). Caesium is the least electronegative of elements with stable isotopes. It is extracted mainly from the zeolite mineral pollucite, while caesium-133 and other radioisotopes are extracted from waste materials generated by nuclear reactors. In the US, the element is called cesium. The spectrum of the metal contains bright lines in the blue. Caesium is soft, silvery gold, and ductile, being the most alkaline and most electropositive element. In cold water, it reacts explosively, also reacting with ice when the temperature is above -116°C. Caesium hydroxide attacks glass and is a strong base. In a study of patterns and rates of deposition and erosion on agricultural land, several conceptual benefits of the use of caesium were identified. First, it allows a retrospective evaluation of mid-term erosion rates. Second, the patterns and rates estimated are the total of all processes of erosion. Third, soil redistribution patterns and rates can be quantitatively assessed. Finally, extreme rates of soil redistribution  have less influence on the estimated soil redistribution rates. Caesium has found a number of practical applications, including in petroleum exploration, electronics and electric power, atomic clocks, isotope and nuclear applications, centrifugation fluids, and more. Caesium formate is used as a drilling fluid, which brings rock cuttings up to the ground, lubricates drill bits, and maintains pressure during the process of drilling. Atomic clocks are made using caesium-133 atoms, observing electromagnetic transitions in them and using this as a reference point. It was only in 1955 when Louis Essen created the first accurate atomic clock at the British Physical Laboratory. Their accuracy was repeatedly improved since then, forming the basis for frequency and time measurements. The element is used in low-power devices called caesium vapor thermionic generators, in which heat energy is converted into electrical energy. The current flow is enhanced by neutralizing space charge in the vacuum tube, which builds up around the cathode. The element has photoemissive properties which make it possible to convert light energy to electron flows. Caesium-based cathodes are used in photoelectric cells because of their low voltage for electrons’ emission. Among the photoemissive devices that use this element are video camera tubes, photomultiplier tubes, and optical character recognition. Other elements that can substitute it are silicon, selenium, rubidium, germanium, tellurium, and others. They can be used in photosensitive materials as well. Solutions of caesium sulfate, chloride, and trifluoroacetate are used due to their low density, particularly in molecular biology. They are commonly employed in density gradient ultracentrifugation. This method is mostly used to isolate fractions, sub-cellular organelles, nuclear acids, and viral particles from biological samples. Finally, caesium has limited application in chemistry, with caesium compounds improving the effectiveness of catalysts when different chemicals are produced. These include methanol, anthraquinone, phthalic anhydride, acrylic acid, ethylene oxide, various olefins, and others. Sulfur dioxide is converted to sulfur trioxide to produce sulfuric acid. "
56,Barium,Ba,137.34,"Barium  (atomic number 56, symbol Ba) is a chemical element and an alkaline earth metal with a soft silvery color. Because of its reactivity with air, this metallic metal is not observed in its pure form in nature. Barium is found in naturally occurring minerals. Among them are witherite, which is a barium carbonate, barite, and barium sulfate. Barium occurs in a combination with other elements, including oxygen, carbon, and sulfur. The metal has half the density of iron and is very light. It forms hydroxide by reacting vigorously with water and oxidizes in air. Barium also forms some poisonous compounds by reacting with most of the non-metals. In terms of its applications, the metal is used in vacuum tubes as oxygen removing and drying agent. Barium is also employed in barium-nickel alloys and in fluorescent lamps. The gas and oil industries use barium compounds to produce drilling mud, which lubricates the drill and makes drilling though rocks easier. Compounds of barium are used to produce rubber, glass, bricks, paint, and tiles. Barium chlorate and nitrate give a green coloration to fireworks. Barium salts give a green color to flames. This occurs, for example, when barium chlorate is added to a burning mixture. One common barium compound is barium sulfate, employed as a filter in resins, plastics, and rubber. Lithophone is a white pigment produced when it is combined with zinc oxide. Blanc fixe is another white pigment when combined with sodium sulfate. When exposed to light, stones that contain impure barium sulfate start glowing. If charcoal is added and stones are intensely heated, they glow up to 6 years in the dark. These stones have been discovered in the region of Bologna in the 15th century and are known as Bologna stones. Alchemists believed they had magic properties. Notably, the compounds of barium are poisonous. Barium sulfate, however, will not dissolve in water and can be ingested. When swallowed, barium sulfate produces x-ray images because it is a good absorber. Another barium compound is barium carbonate, which is employed in the production of certain types of glass and ceramics. It is an element of clay slurries and is employed when drilling oil wells. Some chemical solutions are purified with barium carbonate, and other barium compounds are manufactured by using it as base material. Barium occurs naturally as a mix of 7 stable isotopes. Some 22 isotopes have been identified, and most of them are very radioactive. Barium is found in the minerals witherite in the form of carbonate and in barite – as sulfate. Some deposits of witherite were mined in the northern parts of England till the 1960s. However, almost all the barium today is mined in the form of barite. Extensive barite deposits have been found in India, Germany, Morocco, China, and the United States. Benitoite is a rare gem that contains barium. With regard to health concerns, the amount of barium that has been detected in water and food is typically not high enough as to become hazardous to human health. People who are exposed to high levels of barium are those employed in the barium industry. Barium is dangerous to health when air containing barium carbonate or barium sulphate is breathed. People living close to hazardous waste sites are also at risk, exposed to it by drinking polluted water, eating plants and soil, and breathing dust. "
57,Lanthanum,La,138.9055,"Lanthanum  is a soft, ductile and malleable silvery-white element, which oxidizes rapidly in the air. It belongs to the lanthanide series and is usually found in combination with rare-earth elements such as cerium. Lanthanum is produced from bastnasite and monazite using sophisticated multi-stage extraction techniques. The element was discovered by Carl Mosander in 1832 when the scientist decomposed cerium nitrate and treated and heated the salt using nitric acid. Mosander isolated a new element from the resulting solution and called it lantana. It was in 1923 when the element was isolated in pure form. Lanthanum is in the group of the rare-earths, but it is not a rare element meaning that it is present in large quantities. Bastnasite and monazite are the main ores in which the element occurs, but there is less lanthanum in monazite than in bastnasite. The latter was an obscure and rare mineral until 1949, and it was not considered a source of lanthanides. However, a large deposit was discovered at the Mountain Pass during that year. This alerted scientists to the presence of a rare-earth bearing carbonatite, which was a new class of rare-earth deposits. Other examples were soon discovered, in China and Africa in particular. Regarding commercial applications, the element is used to produce carbon arc lights for projector lights and studio lighting in the motion picture industry. Lanthanum is also employed in the manufacturing of special glasses such as camera lenses. The element can be found in home equipment such as energy-saving lamps, fluorescent lamps, color televisions, and glasses. La2O2 is used in the manufacturing of optical glasses such as telescope and camera lenses and infrared absorbing glass. It enhances the resistance and malleability of steel when added in small amounts. The salts of lanthanum are used in petroleum refining and zeolite catalysts because at high temperatures, they act to stabilize zeolite. Lanthanum is also added to hydrogen sponge alloys, which can store up hydrogen gas up to four hundred times their volume as part of a reversible absorption process. Every time this happens, heat energy is being released meaning that such alloys can be used in energy conversion applications. Lanthanum is also contained in the pyrophoric alloy mischmetal, used in lighter flints. The alloy contains between 25 percent and 45 percent lanthanum. Different components of lanthanum, chlorides, oxides, and other rare-earths are used in petroleum cracking catalysts and other catalysts. When added to tungsten, lanthanum oxide has application in arc welding electrodes. The element rarely occurs in nature and only in small amounts, although it is among the more abundant rare-earths. In a working setting, lanthanum can be dangerous because gasses can be inhaled. Long-term exposure causes lung embolisms. In humans, exposure to lanthanum can cause cancer, especially if inhaled. Large amounts of lanthanum in the body are a threat to the proper functioning of the liver. Lanthanum is disposed of in different places, mostly by the petroleum industry. Thrown away household equipment is another way in which lanthanum can enter the environment. It accumulates in water soils and soils, leading to higher concentrations in soil particles, animals, and humans. In water animals, the element causes cell membrane damage, which affects the functioning of the nervous system and reproduction. "
58,Cerium,Ce,140.12,"Cerium  is a soft, silvery metal, which was named after the dwarf planet Ceres. The planet itself was discovered 2 years earlier. Cerium comprises around 0.0046 percent of the Earth's crust, making it the most often found rare metal on the planet. Minerals such as monazite and bastnasite contain cerium. Monazite is a reddish-brown phosphate mineral, usually found in small and rare crystals. Lanthanum, silica, uranium, thorium, and helium are among the elements found in this mineral. The last can be extracted by heating the mineral.  Bastnasite is a carbonate-fluoride mineral that dates back to 1838. It was first found in Riddarhyttan, Vastermanland, Sweden. There are also abundant deposits of it in the Zagi Mountain region in Pakistan. Bastnasite is found in alkali granite and syenite. Monazite, which is a phosphate mineral, and bastnasite are the main sources of rare earth elements such as cerium. The formula of the mineral is made of yttrium, lanthanum, and cerium, while bastnasite is officially subdivided into three minerals. Cerium is a metal with the appearance of iron, but it is soft and malleable. It has an extremely long liquid range, meaning that it retains liquid form within a very wide temperature range. Only the elements neptunium and thorium have longer liquid ranges than cerium Cerium is notable for its variable electronic structure, which results in dual valency states. This means that the volume changes dramatically when the element is subjected to high pressure or low temperature. The element was discovered in Sweden by Wilhelm Hisinger and Jons Jakob Berzelius in 1803. It was discovered independently in Germany that same year. At the time of discovery, it was not possible to isolate the metal because the technology available was not that advanced, and cerium was much too electropositive. With the advent of electrochemistry, the element was finally isolated. However, it contained less than half of what is known as pure cerium today. Perfectly pure cerium was not obtained until the end of the 1830s, when the chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander managed to remove lanthana and didymia, which are two components of the cerium compound. Cerium is produced by crushing and grinding mineral compounds and treating them with concentrated sulfuric acid. In this way, water-soluble sulfates are created. The acidic particles here are partially neutralized, thorium is removed from the solution, which is then treated to convert the rare earths to their insoluble oxalates. They are transformed into oxides and dissolved in nitric acid. This way, cerium, a major component, is isolated.  Most importantly, what purposes does cerium serve and what are its commercial applications? It is most often used as a catalytic converter to limit the emissions of carbon oxide in exhaust fumes from cars and other vehicles. Cerium oxide is added to diesel fuels to serve this purpose. Cerium is also added to enamel and glass to change their color. In self-cleaning ovens, it is used as a hydrocarbon catalyst and is also put into oven walls and used in petroleum refining. In addition, cerium is used in glass polishing powders and in screens and fluorescent lights. Ceric sulfate is another compound of cerium, which has application in the analysis of chemical processes. Other compounds of cerium are used to remove glass color and to produce some types of glass."
59,Praseodymium,Pr,140.907,"Praseodymium Praseodymium (atomic number 59, symbol Pr) is a metal discovered in 1885 by the German inventor, scientist, and chemist Carl Auer von Welsbach. It was in 1931 when the element was isolated in a relatively pure form. Today, the metal is obtained from bastnasite and monazite sand, and the main mining sites and found in the United States, China, and the Commonwealth of Independent States. The top producers of praseodymium are Brazil, Russia, and China.  The major producer is China, and the estimated reserves are at about 2 million tonnes. Solvent extraction and ion exchange are the main methods used to isolate the element. It is also extracted from samarium (III) chloride through calcium reduction. Praseodymium does not occur freely in nature because it is a very reactive element. Praseodymium is moderately toxic, silvery in color, ductile, and malleable. The element is paramagnetic and has a hexagonal crystal structure. Its Van Der Waals radius is unknown, and its electronegativity according to Pauling is 1.1. Praseodymium has 38 radioisotopes and forms a number of compounds such as bromides, fluorides, oxides, and others. Isotopes of the metal include praseodymium-141, praseodymium-142, and praseodymium-144, which has a half-life of just 7.2 minutes. Praseodymium is in solid state at room temperature but reacts quickly in water. Similar to other rare-earths, the metal should be sealed in plastic or stored under mineral oil. It is moderately toxic. This element is flammable in the form of fumes, dust, and powder. It forms hydrogen gas with dilute acids and water. Praseodymium has different industrial applications and is used to make high-strength metals. Its compounds are used to color glass and enamel and for filtering of infrared radiation. Praseodymium oxide is composed of oxygen and praseodymium and is used to block infrared radiation. It is also an oxidation catalyst when used in a ceria-zirconia solution or ceria solution. The compound has application in the production of ceramics (as a coloring agent). It is used for ceramic glazes and glass coloring. Some torch strikers and lighters also contain small amounts of the element. Mish metal is used for the production of cigarette lighters and contains about 5 percent of praseodymium. Finally, praseodymium is used in the production of household equipment, including energy-saving and fluorescent lamps and color TVs. The element has no biological role. The insoluble salts of praseodymium are non-toxic while the soluble ones have been found to be mildly toxic when ingested. They irritate the eyes and the skin. The element represents a work hazard. It has been found that long-term exposure to its gases can cause lung embolisms. Released by petrol-producing facilities, praseodymium enters the environment and accumulates in water soils and soils. This increases the risk for reproductive problems and cell membrane damage. In addition, it has a negative effect on the functioning of the nervous system. Absorption through the skin is unlikely, but inhalation may cause irritation of the upper respiratory tract. Inhalation and overexposure to praseodymium may aggravate medical conditions such as bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma. It is important to see a doctor if visual changes or irritation occurs. Rinse thoroughly with water and soap in case of skin exposure. Note that antidote is not available. Spills should be disposed of and stored in closed containers. "
60,Neodymium,Nd,144.24,"Neodymium  (atomic number 60, symbol Nd) is a soft and silvery rare earth metal with a bright, metallic luster. This metal is present in the ore minerals bastnasite and monazite and is not found unmixed with other lanthanides or in metallic form. It is no rarer than copper, nickel, and cobalt. Neodymium is mainly mined in China, and other mining areas are found in Australia, Sri Lanka, India, Brazil, and the United States. The annual world production of neodymium oxide stands at 7,000 tonnes, and the total reserves are estimated at about 8,000,000 tonnes. Neodymium has different compounds, including hydroxide, sulfides, halides, and carbide. They remain a popular additive to glass and are used in high power applications and in lasers which emit infrared light. The element itself is used in neodymium magnets for computer hard disks, in-ear headphones, professional loudspeakers, and microphones for which strong magnetic field and low magnet volume and mass are required. Neodymium magnets are stronger, lighter, and cheaper than samarium-cobalt magnets. At the same time, they tend to rust, lose magnetism, and are not superior to samarium-cobalt magnets. Neodymium is useful in cryocoolers because at liquid-helium temperatures, it has a specific heat capacity. Samarium-neodymium dating is used to determine the age relationships of meteorites and rocks. Scanning for isotopes of neodymium makes it possible to predict the strength and size of volcanic eruptions. Large and small volcanic eruptions vary in terms of isotope composition. Scientists look at it to predict the strength of eruptions as to warn residents about their intensity. The color of glass changes under different lighting conditions due to the element’s sharp absorption capacity. It is green under trichromatic lighting and reddish-purple under yellow incandescent light or daylight. This phenomenon is prized by collectors. Beautiful red color results from the combination of selenium and gold. Iron-containing impurities in silica have to be minimized for the best color. Neodymium can be found in equipment such as energy-saving lamps, fluorescent lamps, glasses, and color televisions. It is used in lighter flints in alloys. Boron and iron are the most important alloys of the element, and they make excellent permanent magnets. These alloys are used in loudspeakers and computer data storing. The element is added to didymium glass, which is used in the production of glass blower’s and welder’s goggles. It is also added to glass to create gray, red, and violet colors. Astronomers use glass with neodymium to calibrate spectrometers while other types of glass are added to artificial rubies. Some salts of neodymium are used to color glazes and enamels. Neodymium is among the most abundant rare earths, second to cerium. However, the element has no biological role, and the amount of neodymium in the human body is very small. Neodymium salts and dust are irritating to the eyes, and soluble salts are slightly toxic when digested. Insoluble salts are non-toxic. The element is dangerous in working environments and can be a threat to the liver. Long-term exposure affects the body because gasses and damps can be inhaled with air. Neodymium accumulates in water soils and soils, resulting in increasing concentrations in soil particles, animals, and humans. The element causes damage to the cell membranes of water animals, affecting their reproductive organs and the functions of the nervous system. "
61,Promethium,Pm,144.91,"Promethium Promethium (atomic number 61, symbol Pm) is a metal that rarely occurs in nature. It is an artificially produced and radioactive element and earth metal. It can be obtained from fission products of other elements, including plutonium, thorium, and uranium. The element is found in very small amounts in the composition of uranium ores. Astronomers have observed promethium in the spectra of stars that belong to the Andromeda galaxy. This element is paramagnetic and has 9 isotopes and hexagonal crystal structure. Its electronegativity according to Pauling, ionic radius, and Van Der Waals radius are unknown. The metal is in solid state at room temperature, and its boiling point is 2460 °C. The chemical properties of promethium are little studied because it is radioactive. It is thought to behave similarly to other rare-earths such as cerium, scandium, europium, and neodymium. Its hydration energy and melting point are lower than samarium but higher than neodymium. Over 30 compounds of promethium have been created so far, including binary compounds with hydrogen, oxygen, and halogens. Promethium salts have a greenish or pale blue glow. The element has no stable isotopes and its nuclear isomers are 18 in total. Promethium-151 has a half-life of 1.18 days while promethium-148 has a half-life of about 43 days. The only isotope that has commercial application is promethium-147. All isotopes of the element are radioactive meaning that they have unstable nuclei and release radiation spontaneously. All elements from the periodic table have at least one radioactive isotope. However, there are only two elements with an atomic number below 83 – promethium and technetium – that have radioactive isotopes only. The element itself does not have a stable state.Promethium-147 is used in atomic batteries. The element can be used as a power source because it releases energy. Promethium-based batteries are an alternative to other battery types which are too large or heavy. They are an effective energy source on space probs and satellites but are very expensive for everyday use. Batteries of this kind are expected to provide power for up to 5 years. Other possible applications of promethium are in the manufacturing of batteries for pacemakers, watches, and missiles. Promethium was discovered by the US chemist Jacob Marinsky in 1945. Lawrence Glendenin and Jacob Marinsky used neutrons to bombard neodymium and produced promethium. They were also successful in extracting the metal from fission products. It was only in 1963 that a sample of promethium was produced. Today, scientists use particle accelerators to artificially isolate the element. Spectroscopes have been used to detect the presence of promethium and its isotopes. The element has no biological role. Its oceanic and crustal abundance are unknown. Given that promethium is a rare metal, it poses no threat to animal and plant life. Laboratory tests have shown that the metal accumulates on the surface of bones. It takes time to be released from the body. Promethium is very radioactive and should be handled with care. Protective clothing, safety glasses, and gloves should be worn. All compounds of promethium are highly toxic, and metal dust should be handled with care. It presents an explosion and fire hazard. Promethium was originally present on earth but is now found in trace amounts. It disappeared because of radioactive decay. The element is only handled in nuclear facilities and research laboratories. "
62,Samarium,Sm,150.35,"Samarium This element is a soft metal with moderate paramagnetic properties. It is stable in air and solid at room temperature. Its Van Der Waals radius and ionic radius are unknown. Stable in dry air, oxide coating forms at higher humidity levels. When it oxidizes, it forms powder in gray-yellow that consists of hydroxides and oxides. The best way to store the metal is under argon or another inert gas. There are 21 known isotopes and samarium forms different compounds, including borides, halides, chalcogenides, and oxides. The element also has nuclear isomers and radioisotopes and stable isotopes such as Sm-154, Sm-152, Sm-150, Sm-144, and others. Some isotopes have a half life of 340 days while others, for example, Sm-153 have a half life of just 1.92 days. The metal is present in different minerals, including monazite, samarskite, and gadolinite. It is also found in cerite, bastanite, monazite, and other minerals (usually it is found in monazite). Ores that contain samarium are found in countries such as Sri Lanka, Australia, India, Brazil, China, and the United States. Many mining sites are found on the territory of the People’s Republic of China. Different techniques are used for processing, isolation, and extraction, including electrochemical disposition, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. Heavy extraction processes are usually used at mining sites. In terms of industrial and commercial applications, samarium is used in nuclear reactors and optical lasers. The metal is also used as a reducing agent for different types of reactions, including the Barbier reaction, Holton Taxol total syntheses, Danishefsky, desulfonylation reactions, and others. One gram of samarium costs about $3.60. The element is also used in the ceramics and electronics industries, to produce catalysts and special types of glasses, and in TV screens. It has applications in radiography, interferometry, high-resolution microscopy, holography, and many other fields. Some of the isotopes are also used for meteorite and rock dating. Finally, samarium is also used in headphones, alloys with cobalt, lasers, organic reagents, and carbon-arc lightning. Samarium-cobalt magnets were used in the 70s to reduce the size of many items – speakers, boom boxes, PC disk drives, cassette tape players, etc. While these magnets are expensive, they are strong and have many applications. One reason why they are preferred over other magnets is that they can be used in high temperature settings. Because of this, they are widely used in hybrid electric vehicles. Magnets also have application in industries where low energy consumption is an important factor. Samarium-cobalt magnets have good spectral absorption properties and are also added to applications that use microwave frequencies. Samarium is also used for therapeutic purposes. Some cancer treatments use the radioisotope samarium-153 to alleviate severe pain due to metastasis. The metal is also used to produce flints in combination with neodymium, cerium, and lanthanum. Ethanol is dehydrated with the use of samarium, which serves as a catalyst. According to researchers, samarium speeds up metabolism. In the human body, the metal is found in the bloodstream, kidneys, and liver. Exposure may cause eye and skin irritation because the salts and compounds are found to be moderately to highly toxic. The metal has been found in some plants and animals as well. "
63,Europium,Eu,151.25,"Europium The chemical element , obviously named after the continent, has atomic number 63 the symbol Eu. It oxidizes easily in air and water and is part of the lanthanide series, also known as rare earth elements. Eu is found in oxidation states +3 and +2. Notwithstanding the fact that Eu is a heavy metal, it is comparatively non-toxic. From a practical viewpoint, it is most useful as a phosphorescent europium compound.This element was discovered in 1896 by the French chemist Eugene-Antole Demarcay. He noticed that samples of samarium, which was recently discovered, were contaminated with some unknown chemical. Demarcay was unable to produce pure europium. Nowadays, the element is mostly produced from monazite sand via an ion exchange process. It does not have a significant biological role. Europia or europium oxide is commonly employed as a doping agent in computer monitors and television sets. Blue radiance is produced by valency two europium and red radiance by valency three europium. The combination of both valencies produces white light, which is used in fluorescent bulbs. Phosphors containing europium are used in anti-forgery marks on EURO banknotes. The element is also used in geochemistry and petrology to understand the processes behind the formation of rocks, which have cooled from magma or lava.Europium is a ductile metal, which means that it is malleable and easily shaped. Of all the rare earth elements, Eu has the lowest density and the second lowest melting point. Below 1.8 K (Kelvin temperature), the element is a superconductor because it becomes trivalent under pressure, and it must be compressed to over 80 GPa to achieve this state. This element also has the highest reactivity rate of all rare earth elements. It quickly oxidizes in air and also reacts with water. Europium forms europium (III) oxide and dissolves in dilute sulfuric acid to form hydrated Eu (III). Eu has two isotopes - 151Eu and 153Eu. The latter is by far the more abundant of the two. It is also more stable than the former. The isotopes of europium are good absorbers of neutrons and are used in control rods in nuclear reactors. The element also has 35 artificial radioisotopes, and the two mentioned above are the natural ones. Of these, the most stable is 150Eu with a half-life of 36.9 years. Europium has 8 meta states, the most stable being 150mEu with a half-life of 12.8 hours. Europium is a by-product of nuclear fission. It is less radioactive than caesium and strontium. A large number of naturally occurring minerals contain europium. It is most frequently found in bastnasite, monazite, xenotime and loparite and does not occur in a pure form in nature. Several methods have been used for its extraction from ore, and the choice of method is determined by the ore composition, concentration, and the distribution of the separate lanthanides. Europium metal reacts with all of the halogens. This yields gray europium (III) bromide (EuBr3), yellow europium (III) chloride, white europium (III) fluoride (EuF3), and colorless europium (III) iodide. It also yields a large number of dihalides. Among the known oxides of europium are europium (II) oxide and the mixed oxide. "
64,Gadolinium,Gd,157.25,"Gadolinium This metal has some very useful properties, however, making its application quite feasible. For example, less than one percent of the metal improves the resistance and workability of chromium, iron, and other similar alloys to oxidation and high temperatures. It absorbs neutrons at a very high rate, thus making its use in nuclear reactors very effective and viable. The trivalent ions that this metal forms are used as phosphors because of their fluorescent properties, which is something typical of rare earth metals. One isotope of gadolinium, Gd-157, has the highest thermal neutron capture of all stable nuclides. It reaches 259,000 barns. The only element with a higher cross section is an isotope of xenon, xenon-135, which is rather unstable. Gadolinium attracts iron objects at temperatures lower than 20 °C (68 °F). When it enters a magnetic field, its temperature increases. When it leaves the field, it decreases correspondingly. In combination with other elements, gadolinium forms what are known as Gd (III) derivatives. These include boron, nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon. Other derivatives are selenium, sulfur, silicon, and arsenic. It forms the gadolinium (III) oxide when it interacts with moist air.Usually this element adopts the oxidation state +3. This means it features four trihalides, all of which are known. Salts such as gadolinium (III) nitrate are produced when the oxide of the element dissolves in acids. Gadolinium acts as a very powerful reducing agent, reducing the oxides of a number of metals into their elements. Gadolinium exhibits a slow reaction with cold water and a very fast one with hot water, whereby gadolinium hydroxide is formed.  Gadolinium is used in control rods for nuclear power plants as well as nuclear reactors. It is also used in the production of garnets for various microwave applications. The production of phosphorous used in color TV tubes involves compounds of gadolinium. Metallic gadolinium is not used as often as the metal; however, electronic components and magnets are made by using its alloys. Alloys are used for components like recording heads for video recorders. Computer memory and compact discs are also produced using gadolinium. Gadolinium has a range of specialized uses, among which targetting tumors in neutron therapy in medicine, as a back-up shut-down measure in nuclear reactors, and in nuclear marine propulsion systems. Gd has six stable isotopes and one radioactive isotope. The most frequently found isotope in nature is Gd-158. The others are 154, 155, 156, 157 and 160. The radioactive one is Gd-152.  "
65,Terbium,Tb,158.924,"Terbium  (number 65, symbol Tb) is an earth metal and chemical element that can be extracted from minerals such as bastnaesite and monazite.

He studied the mineral gadolinite which contains dysprosium, terbium, ytterbium, thulium, and yttrium, all of which being rare earth elements. Today the major mining sites are found in Australia, Brazil, China, Sri Lanka, India, and the United States. The largest site is found on the territory of Southern China. Terbium is soft, ductile, malleable, and silvery-grey in color and oxidizes slowly.

Some of the isotopes have a short half life of less than 30 seconds. The nuclear isomers are 27 in number, and Tb-156m is the most stable isomer. This element has a hexagonal close-packed structure and forms fluorides, iodides, bromides, and chlorides. The Vanderwaals and ionic radius are unknown. Its boiling point is 5505 °F (3041°C), and its melting point is 2480 °F (1360 °C) The metal is used as a dopant in different compounds, including strontium molybdate, calcium tungstate, and calcium fluoride. In general, there are few uses because the element is expensive and rare. It is mainly used in fuel cells, television tubes, semiconductor and electronic devices, and lasers. The metal is also used in magnetomechanical devices, sonar systems, actuators, and alloys. In addition, the element is used to make high definition screens and lighting fixtures, including trichromatic lighting.Terbium has applications in biochemistry as well. Together with UV light, its ions are used to detect microorganisms. Tb ions also make it possible to detect counterfeit banknotes.  Magnets for hybrid vehicles contain an alloy of dysprosium, terbium, and neodymium. Wind turbines that are powered by electric motors also contain magnets. They generate energy at high temperatures.  Electrolysis and reduction are used to produce the metal. Calcium metal is used to reduce anhydrous chloride or fluoride. It is also obtained from monazite sand, euxenite, and xenotime. It doesn’t occur as a free element but is found in different ores. The annual world production totals 10 tonnes. The element is mildly toxic but its compounds irritate the eyes and skin. It is not considered environmental hazard and poses no threat to plant and animal life. It has no biological role and is difficult to isolate. Further research on toxicity is required."
66,Dysprosium,Dy,162.5,"Dysprosium  is a rare element, which is never found as a free element in nature. It has seven isotopes. Dysprosium was discovered in 1886, but it was not isolated until later, when ion exchange methods started to be used. The element was discovered by the French chemist de Boisbaudran as an impurity in erbium's oxide erbia. It was isolated in 1906 by another French chemist, Georges Urbain. However, it was only in the 1950s when pure samples were produced.  Dysprosium is a component of fergusonite, xenotime, blomstrandine, euxenite, gadolinite, polycrase, and other minerals. Currently, most of the dysprosium deposits are found in mines located in southern China. It is rarely found in the Earth’s crust and in sea water. Dysprosium is produced mainly by means of processing monazite sand, which is a compound containing a large number of phosphates. The metal is derived as a by-product in the extraction of yttrium. It is isolated by using magnetic processes. About 100 tons of the metal are obtained worldwide each year. The price of dysprosium has increased by almost 20 between 2003 and 2010. According to informed sources, this metal is among the most important components in newly emerging clean energy technologies. It is believed that we will experience a drastic shortage of dysprosium in 2015 and after that.Dysprosium may be used to make laser materials jointly with other elements. Such materials are vanadium as well as other earth elements. The element is also used to produce control rods in nuclear reactors and in data storage, because it is highly magnetic. Given that dysprosium has a high melting point and absorbs neutrons easily, it can be used in nuclear reactors when alloyed with steal.  Dysprosia or dysprosium oxide is used for cooling nuclear reactor tubes. To this purpose, it is added to a special type of cement after being combined with nickel. Other compounds of dysprosium include dysprosium sulfate, dysprosium iodide, and dysprosium fluoride. A small part of the composition of neodymium-iron-boron magnets may be replaced by dysprosium in order to enhance the power capacity for applications in drive motors for hybrid-type electricity-driven vehicles. Experts estimate that this will take around 100 grams of the metal for every hybrid car that is manufactured. If you take the figure two million – which is how many cars Toyota makes in a year – it is easy to see even for a layman that we are going to run out of supplies of the metal. Dysprosium is resistant to corrosion, which makes it a very good choice for a wide variety of applications apart from that in vehicles.  The metal is also used in Terfenol-D, a compound with extremely high room-temperature magnetostriction, in dosimeters, catalysts, high intensity lighting, and more. Terfenol-D as a substance is used in transducers, high-precision liquid fuel injectors and broadband mechanical resonators. Two compounds of dysprosium, dysprosium bromide and dysprosium iodide are used to make high-intensity lighting. These compounds release dysprosium ions, which produce bright light by re-emitting. Dosimeters are used to measure ionizing radiation. This happens by mixing the metal with calcium sulfate or calcium fluoride, types of crystals. When these have been subjected to radiation, dysprosium becomes luminescent, which is used as an indicator to establish to what exposure the dosimeter has been subjected."
67,Holmium,Ho,164.93,"Holmium  is a rare earth element, which is part of the lanthanide series. It was in 1878 when its oxide was extracted from earth ores, and holmium was named after Stockholm, Sweden. The element was discovered by the Swedish chemist Per Theodor Cleve, and he employed the same method used by Mosander to discover terbium, erbium, and lanthanum. Cleve was looking for impurities in oxides, starting with the oxide of erbium erbia. After removing contaminants and further processing, two new materials were formed, one was green in color, and the other was brown. Cleve named the green one thulia and the brown one holmia. Thulia is thulium oxide while holmia is holmium oxide. The absorption spectrum of holmium was previously observed by the Swiss chemists M. Delafontaine and J. L. Soret. In terms of properties, Holmium is silvery white in color and relatively malleable and soft. It is not found in pure form in nature because holmium is too reactive; however, it is relatively stable at room temperature and in dry air when isolated. Holmium rusts easily when reacting with water, and when heated, it burns in air. At higher temperatures and in moist air, holmium oxidizes and forms a yellowish-colored oxide. Holmium has a bright silvery, metallic luster in pure form. The lightning conditions make holmium appear differently colored. It has a tannish yellow coloration in daylight while under trichromatic light, it looks like erbium oxide and is orange red. This element is found in the composition of minerals like gadolinite and monazite, with ion exchange techniques being used to extract holmium from monazite. In laboratory conditions and in nature, the compounds of holmium contain Ho (III) ions and are trivalently oxidized. There is one stable isotope of holmium – holmium-165. Radioactive isotopes have been discovered as well, and holmium-163 is the most stable of them. Its half-life is 4570 years.This element is also characterized by high magnetic strength, and it is actually the highest of all elements. Because of this, holmium is used to make the polepieces of strong static magnets. Absorbing nuclear-fission bred neutrons, holmium is employed in nuclear control rods as well. Holmium oxide has application as yellow gas coloring. The element is used in solid-state lasers produced for microwave equipment. The latter is made for different dental and medical lasers and is safe for the eyes. Holmium lasers are used in fiber-optical, dental, and medical applications. In addition, the element is a colorant for glass and cubic zirconia, giving red or yellow coloring. Glass that contains holmium oxide solutions or holmium oxide has sharp peaks in optical absorption. They are in the spectral range 200 – 900 nm. The long-lived and radioactive Ho-166m1 is used to calibrate gamma ray spectrometers. While holmium is a rare earth element, it is twenty times more abundant than silver. It is not found uncombined in nature and global production is about ten tonnes a year, with the major mining sites being in Sri Lanka, India, Brazil, the United States, China, and Australia. This element does not have any biological role and is among the least abundant elements found in our bodies. Although holmium has a low acute toxic rating, it acts to stimulate metabolism. Is poses no environmental threat to animal and plant life. "
68,Erbium,Er,167.26,"Erbium  is a chemical element that is part of the lanthanide series. The so-called lanthanide elements include the fifteen metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers ranging from 57 to 71, as well as scandium and yttrium. The last two are not lanthanide elements, strictly speaking, but are categorized along with them because they are chemically similar. This series is known to constitute the rare earth elements. The name of these elements is misleading because they are actually not rare at all. They are called 'rare' because they are rarely found in concentrated and exploitable forms. When they are, they are considered part of the “rare earth mineral series”. So, then, erbium has the symbol Er and the atomic number 68. When found in nature, Er is always found as part of a compound with another or other elements. When isolated it is silvery-white in color and solid. The element was discovered in a quarry near the Swedish town Ytterby. The Swedish chemist Carl Gustaf Mosander separated gadolinite into 3 materials and named them terbia, erbia, and yttria. This happened in 1843. Because of their similar properties and names, researchers soon confused two of them, terbia and erbia. Their names were reversed by 1877. Mosander discovered two other elements from these two – erbium and terbium. Today, the former is mainly produced from the minerals euxenite and xenotime. There are several practical applications of Er, among which as optical amplification media glasses and crystals and in dermatology, dentistry, and other subfields of medicine. When alloyed with vanadium, erbium makes it softer to touch and easier to shape. The element is also used as a doping agent in fiber optic cables. It is thus used as a signal amplifier. There are some uses of the element in the nuclear power industry as well. Erbium oxide is a compound of erbium. Due to its pink color, erbium oxide is used to color glazes and glasses. Other compounds of erbium include erbium chloride, erbium fluoride, and erbium iodide. Er is a trivalent element. When in pure form, it is easily shaped, soft but stable, and does not oxidize very quickly. The salts of the element are rose-colored. Its chemical and physical properties are different depending on the kind and amount of impurities that are part of it. Er is believed to enhance the human metabolism rate. This element can be ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and paramagnetic depending on the temperature. It has these properties at below 19 K (degrees in Kelvin), between 19 and 80 K, and above 80 K, respectively. The metal erbium burns when in contact with air, forming erbium (III) oxide. It shows a slow reaction with cold water, but a very fast one with hot water, and forms erbium hydroxide. It has a reaction with every halogen and dissolves in dilute sulfuric acid easily, forming solutions that contain hydrated Er (III) ions. Er has six stable isotopes – 162 Er, 164 Er, 166 Er, 167 Er, 168 Er, and 170 Er. Er 166 is found in the highest quantities in nature. The most stable isotope is 169 (of the radioactive ones). It has the longest half-life of all the radioactive isotopes of Er - 9.4 days. "
69,Thulium,Tm,168.934,"Thulium  (atomic number 69, symbol Tm) is a rare earth metal and chemical element that was isolated in 1879 by Per Theodor Cleve. The same method was used to isolate other elements, including terbium, erbium, and lanthanum.  It was only in 1911 when pure thulium was isolated. This is a rare and expensive element which belongs to the group of lanthanides. Thulium is ductile and malleable and has a silver luster. It has a hexagonal close-packed structure and three oxidation states - 4, 3, and 2. This element is solid at room temperature and has a boiling point of 3536 F (1947 °C) and melting point of 2813 °F (1545 °C). It is volatile in liquid form and tarnishes when exposed to water or air. The ionic and Vanderwaals radius of thulium are unknown. Tm-169 is the isotope with the longest half life. There are 5 stable isotopes – Tm-171, Tm-170, Tm-169, Tm-178, and Tm-167. The element reacts with hydrogen chloride, halogens, metals, and nonmetals and forms compounds such as trimedoxine bromide, thulium nutride, and others. Chalcogenides are formed when thulium reacts with chalcogens such as astatine, iodine, bromine, chlorine, and fluorine. These elements have similar chemical properties. The compounds are yellow or white in color. Thulium hydroxide and hydrogen gas are formed when water reacts with thulium dichloride. The only oxide is thulium oxide powder. Thulium is found in countries such as the United States, Tanzania, India, Greenland, Brazil, and Australia. The main deposits are in China. Major reserve holders also include the Commonwealth of Independent States and the U.S. Top producers include Brazil, Russia, and China. The total reserves are estimated at 100,000 tonnes. The element is not found in nature and occurs in minerals that contain gadolinium and yttrium. It is also found in minerals such as euxenite, xenotime, monazite, and gadolinite. The main methods of extraction include solvent extraction and ion exchange. Calcium reduction is also used.  Thulium has several applications in meteorology and medicine and is used in X-ray devices, radiation dosimeters, and lasers. X-ray devices that contain thulium are lightweight and portable. One of its isotopes, Tm-170 is used in brachytherapy. Also known as endocurietherapy and curietherapy, it is used to treat skin, breast, prostate, and other types of cancer. Brachytherapy is also used together with other treatments such as chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy and to treat tumors. None of its compounds is commercially important, however. Given that thulium is expensive, it is most often used for research purposes. The element is added to arc lighting and high-temperature superconductors. While thulium is found in the human body, it has no biological role. Soluble salts, have been found to speed metabolism. Insoluble salts are non-toxic and safe while soluble ones are slightly toxic. The element poses no threat to plant and animal life and is thus not considered environmental hazard."
70,Ytterbium,Yb,173.04,"Ytterbium  (symbol Yb, atomic number 70) is a naturally formed chemical element known to science since the 1840s. The element's atomic weight is just over 173. Ytterbium has a melting point of 809 C, and boiling point of 1196 C. The element has a density of 6.9 grams per cubic centimetre. At room temperature, Ytterbium is in a solid state. As per the elements classification system, Ytterbium is metal. This is a ductile, malleable, and soft element with a silvery luster. It oxidizes when exposed to air and reacts with mineral acids. It is a rare earth element belonging to the lanthanide series. Its compounds are quite rare and include halides and oxides. The element reacts with bromine, chlorine, fluorine, and iodine. While this is a relatively stable element, closed containers are used to protect Ytterbium from moisture and air. The gadonilite ore extracted from the mines and quarries around the Ytterby village had to be separated into its basic elements. A Swedish chemist by the name of Carl Gustaf Mosander was eventually able to do this in 1843. He separated the ore down to three basic elements which he called: erbia, terbia and yttria. As the names given to erbia and terbia were very similar, and so were their chemical and physical properties, Carl Mosander had to reverse the names of the two elements as the scientific community was rather confused by the similarities. The name reversal took place in 1877. About a decade later, Jean C.G. de Marignac – a Swiss chemist ran some tests and realised that the element which Mosander had earlier called erbia was in fact made of two other more basic components. He managed to separate the two and named one of them ytterbia, the other kept the name erbia. The person who got the credit for the official discovery of Ytterbium was the Swiss chemist Jean de Marignac.In modern times, Ytterbium is extracted from rare earth minerals, mainly from monzonite sand, through a process known as ion exchange. Production may involve the use of potassium which reacts with Ytterbium trichloride. Annual production totals about 50 tonnes.  The main mining sites are found in Australia, Sri Lanka, India, Brazil, the United States, and China. Ytterbium has only a few uses, though they are quite useful. Ytterbium is used to improve certain mechanical properties of stainless steel through adding it in the steel in order to create an alloy. Ytterbium is also sometimes used as a so called doping agent in fibre optic cables where it amplifies signals travelling back and forth. Portable X-ray machines also make use of certain isotopes contained in Ytterbium. There is no known biological role. However, Ytterbium causes eye and skin irritations. Its compounds are very toxic and are kept in closed containers. Ytterbium dust is considered an explosion and fire hazard. "
71,Lutetium,Lu,194.967,"Lutetium This element has the atomic number 71 and the symbol Lu. It was discovered in 1907 in France, Austria, and America independently. Eventually, it was determined that the discovery in France by Georges Urbain slightly predated the others and the honor went to him. He named the element lutecium. In 1949, the spelling of the element was changed, and it became lutetium. Earlier traces of the element were also found in the mineral ytterbia, but it was determined that it was a separate element. Previously, it was believed that the mineral was composed only of ytterbium. The atom of this element has 71 electrons. In a chemical reaction, the atom loses its 5d electron and the two farthest from the nucleus. One peculiarity of the lanthanide series is that the size of the atoms decreases as the atomic number increases, which is why lutetium atoms are smaller than all the others of the elements in the series. This element is silvery white in color, and it is resistant to corrosion and trivalent. Two isotopes of it occur naturally - lutetium-175 and lutetium-176. The first is stable, while the second has an amazing half-life of 3.78×1010 years. There are 32 man-made isotopes of lutetium. Their masses vary from 149.973 to 183.961. The radioactive isotopes of the element have half-lives of under 9 days, with most of them being under half an hour. It has few known uses, and the reason is that lutetium is rare and expensive. The element is found in small amounts with other rare-earths, but it is difficult to separate it from them. Some radioactive isotopes of lutetium are used in nuclear technology as a way to date meteorites. Since it co-occurs with yttrium frequently, the compound is used to catalyze different reactions, as well as in metal alloys. One of the isotopes of lutetium is also used to treat tumors. Another use of lutetium is in cracking petrol in refineries, polymerization, and hydrogenation. In addition, the element is used in magnetic bubble memory devices by adding it to gadolinium gallim garnet. The main mining sites are located in Australia, Sri Lanka, India, Brazil, the United States, and China. The world reserves of lutetium are estimated at about 200,000 tonnes. The annual production of lutetium is around 10 tonnes, in the form of lutetium oxide. Those working with this element should keep in mind that inhaling lutetium fluoride is dangerous. The element is mildly toxic when ingested, but the soluble salts of lutetium are non-toxic. Similar to other rare-earth metals, this element is said to have a low toxicity rating. However, the compounds of lutetium should be handled with care. Metal dust of the element is an explosion and fire hazard. Lutetium poses no threat to animal and plant life. "
72,Hafnium,Hf,178.49,"Hafnium  is a transitional metal and a chemical element, which chemically resembles zirconium. It is a silvery grey, lustrous, and ductile metal found in zirconium minerals. Hafnium is also corrosion resistant, but zirconium impurities affect its physical properties and its nuclear properties, in particular. Due to their chemical similarity, hafnium and zirconium are difficult to separate. Density is one difference between them, and the density of zirconium is around one-half that of hafnium. Other differences between zirconium and hafnium are their boiling points and melting points as well as their solubility in solvents. In terms of nuclear properties, the element has several isotopes that absorb neutrons readily. The element was discovered by the Hungarian chemist de Hevesy and the Danish chemist Dirk Coster in 1923. The scientists employed X-ray spectroscopy to study samples of zirconium ore and the arrangement of outer electrons in hafnium. Niels Bohr predicted its electron structure while Hevesy discovered a matching pattern. Normally, hafnium does not affect human health, but its compounds are considered toxic. Initial research suggests that the danger is limited. However, metal dust is known to pose explosion and fire hazard. The metal is not toxic itself and insoluble in body chemicals, saline solutions, and water. Exposure to the chemical can occur through skin and eye contact, ingestion, and inhalation. Overexposure to compounds of hafnium and hafnium itself causes mild irritation of the mucous membranes, skin, and eyes. No symptoms and signs of chronic exposure to the element have been observed and reported. Given that hafnium absorbs neutrons, it is used in nuclear reactors’ control rods. As an alloying agent, the element is also used in niobium, titanium, iron, and other metals. Hafnium is employed in high-temperature ceramics and alloys because some compounds of the element are refractory. They do not melt except under very high temperature. Two hafnium ores are known – alvite and hafnon although they are rare. Over 34 isotopes have been discovered, and their mass number ranges from 153 to 186. There are 5 stable isotopes of hafnium. Hafnium-based compounds are used in the electronics industry and in gate insulators, in particular, generating integrated circuits  (IBM, Intel, and others). Compounds of hafnium, which are oxide-based, are high-k dielectrics. The gate leakage current is thus reduced, with performance at such scales being enhanced. Given hafnium’s affinity to nitrogen and oxygen and its heat resistance, the element is a good scavenger for nitrogen and oxygen in incandescent lamps. In plasma cutting, the metal is used as an electrode because it sheds electrons into the air. A nuclear isomer of hafnium was researched as part of the US-funded program DARPA. The program assessed the possibility of using it to develop high-yield weapons with mechanisms that trigger X-rays. Because of the high costs, the use of induced gamma emission was considered infeasible. There are a few applications of hafnium, and several factors contribute to this. The first is the similarity between zirconium and hafnium, making it possible to employ zirconium instead of hafnium in most applications. Second, the difficult separation methods and its low abundance on earth make hafnium a scarce commodity. Third, this metal was available in a pure form only in the late 50s and after its application in the nuclear industry. "
73,Tantalum,Ta,180.948,"Tantalum  This element is a transition metal with a body-centered cubic structure. It has good electrical and heat conductivity and is hard, ductile, and dense. It has a boiling point of 6,000 C (10,832 F) and a melting point of 2,850 C (5,162 F). Its melting point is high but lower than that of carbon, osmium, rhenium, and tungsten. Tantalum is made of two isotopes – Ta-181 and Ta-180m. The half life of Ta-180 is just 8 hours. It forms carbides, fluorides, and oxides, including tantalum carbide, pentachloride, and pentoxide as well as lanthanum tantalate, lithium tantalate, and others. Other compounds include tantalum sulfide, silicide, nitride, carbide, etc. Common oxidation states are -1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. A number of minerals contain tantalum, including polycrase, euxenite, wodginite, microlite, and tantalite. The element is usually obtained from tantalite. Tantalite ores contain minerals and metals such as samarskite, niobium, manganese, and iron. Pyrochlore ores are another source of niobium and tantalum and are found in Canada, Portugal, Brazil, Congo, and other countries. Tantalum deposits are found in Wodgina and the Greenbushes in Australia. Both sites were operated by Global Advanced Metals which focuses on the production, extraction, and development of tantalum metals. The Wodgina mine was closed in 2012.  Small amounts are also produced in Canada and Brazil.  Tantalum is used to manufacture surgical implants, capacitors, aircraft engines, and alloys. It is used to produce high-temperature devices because of its high melting point. The element also has application in the chemical industry because of its good corrosion resistance. It is used to manufacture refractive index glass, electron tubes, and alloys for missiles, nuclear reactors, High concentrations of tantalum can contribute to environmental pollution. Small amounts have been found in plants. Exposure by skin contact, ingestion, and inhalation may cause respiratory problems and skin and eye irritation. Health hazards and dangers include dangers of explosion, inhalation, and exposure. Tantalum pentoxide is a colorless solid that reacts with oxidizers and can cause explosions and fire. Cases of poisoning due to exposure have not been reported, but tantalum is moderately toxic, and if processing involves cutting, melting, or grinding, high concentrations of fumes or dust may be released into the air. Workers who are exposed to tantalum must meet respiratory, skin protection, and eye protection requirements, as well as ventilation requirements. They must wear respirators, protective gloves, safety glasses, and other protective equipment. Depending on the facility and production processes, air samples may be taken frequently or at regular intervals. While tantalum is stable, it reacts violently with different compounds and substances, including halocarbons, halogens, copper(II) oxide, and bromine monofluoride. Under normal circumstances, the metal poses no environmental or health hazards. Dust and powder, however, are harmful and contribute to air and water pollution. Releases, spills, and emissions must be contained and controlled. There are different control methods, for example, exhaust ventilation and dilution ventilation. Ignition sources are removed in areas where metallic tantalum is processed. "
74,Tungsten,W,183.85,"Tungsten  (atomic number 74, symbol W) is a metal and chemical element that was discovered in 1781 by the Swedish mineralogist and chemist Torbern Bergman. It was in 1783 when the element was isolated for the first time. Fausto Elhuyar and Juan Jose Elhuyar isolated tungsten from wolframite. Tungsten has a high melting point and is silvery-white in color. This is a lustrous metal with high density and robustness. It resists attack by alkalis, acids, and oxygen and reacts with alkaline solutions. The element has a low vapor pressure, high melting point of 6170 F (3410 C), and is grayish in powder form.  It has good corrosion resistance and is ductile. Tungsten has 30 synthetically made radioisotopes, and W-187, W-178, W-188, W-185, and W-181 are the most stable ones. The element has a body-centered cubic structure and reacts with alkali metals. It is solid at room temperature and has paramagnetic properties. Tungsten occurs in different minerals, including hubnerite, ferberite, scheelite, and wolframite. There are several tungsten-containing minerals such as russellite, billwiseite, and ferberite. Billwiseite, for example, is found in the Himalayas and contains rare elements such as tungsten, tantalum, niobium, and antimony. Stolzite is found in the Czech Republic  and occurs together with minerals such as mimetite, pyromorphite, and anglesite. The major producers of tungsten are Canada, Bolivia, and Austria. Other producers include Russia, Portugal, and China, with annual world production totaling around 61,000 tonnes. This metal has a number of chemical and commercial applications. It is used to produce fluorescent lights, ceramic glazes, tail ballast and ballast keels, counterweights, and X-ray tubes. Its compounds are used to make turning and mining tools, circular saws, drills, knives, and other tools and equipment for the construction, mining, woodworking, and other industries. The metal is also used to make jewelry and ornaments. Alloys are widely used, especially in the aerospace and automobile industries. Missiles and components for spacecraft and furnaces are also produced using tungsten.  Heavy alloys are made by combining tungsten with elements such as cobalt, iron, nickel, and others. The metal is alloyed with steel to manufacture nozzles and cutting tools. Alloys are used in the military industry to make missiles and grenades. One of its compounds, tungsten carbide is used in mining equipment, cutting tools, and drill bits. Tungsten compounds that contain magnesium and calcium are used to manufacture fluorescent light bulbs. Tungsten poses no environmental hazards and no chronic health effects have been reported. Side effects include skin and eye irritations, itching, scaling, and reddening, and irritation of the mucus membrane and lungs. It is important to get familiar with safe handling and hygiene practices. Tungsten compounds have a high toxicity. The element forms different compounds, including selenides, sulfides, oxides, and iodides. Other compounds include bromides and chlorides such as tungsten trichloride, ditungsten decachloride, and tungsten hexachloride. The element also forms carbonyls and tellurides. "
75,Rhenium,Re,186.2,"Rhenium  (atomic number 75, symbol Re) is a metal with a silvery-white color, high density, and high melting point. Only platinum, osmium, and iridium have higher densities than rhenium. It is a transition metal that is solid at room temperature and has similar chemical properties to technetium and manganese. The metal was discovered in 1925 by Garl Berg, Walter Noddack, and Ida Tacke-Noddack. This is the last naturally occurring, non-radioactive, and stable chemical element to be isolated. Rhenium is a rare metal with good refractory properties similar to niobium, tantalum, molybdenum, and tungsten. It has good resistance to heat, oxidation, and corrosion.  The metal has a high melting point of 3170 °C (5738 °F), and only tungsten and carbon have higher melting points than rhenium. It has a hexagonal structure and high tensile strength. The most common oxidation states are +2, + 4, +6, and +7.  Rhenium-185 is the only stable isotope. The metal also forms a number of compounds, including sulfides, oxides, oxyhalides, and halides. Rhenium diboride, for example, has hardness that is comparable to compounds such as zirconium diboride, titanium diboride, and silicon carbide. In nature, the element is composed of two isotopes – Re-187 and Re-185. The metal is found in copper ores and the mineral molybdenite, with deposits in New Mexico, Utah, Arizona, and Colorado. Small amounts are present in molybdenum and platinum ores. The metal is usually obtained through copper refining. In addition to platinum ores, the metal is also found in small concentrations in minerals such as gadolinite and columbite. Berg and Noddack were successful in isolating just one gram from more than 650 kg of mineral mass. Chile has the largest deposits of rhenium on a global scale. Deposits are also found in Russia and the United States. The total production amounts to up to 50 tons a year while estimated reserves total about 3,500 tonnes. The major producers operate in Poland, Peru, the U.S., Canada, and Chile. Rhenium has good resistance to poisoning with phosphorus, sulfur, and nitrogen. It is added to molybdenum and tungsten alloys and used in nickel-based alloys. Alloys are used to produce X-ray anodes and X-ray tubes while the metal is incorporated in plating, jewelry, igniters for flash bulbs, electrodes, thermocouples, electrical contacts, components for missiles, and other products and equipment.  The metal is also used in jet engines and gas turbines. The main reason why it is added to alloys is that it is stable at high temperatures. Other reasons include resistance to arc corrosion and wear and low vapor pressure. It is also used in photoflash lamps, ion gauges, and spectrometers. Filaments for lamps and ovens are produced using rhenium. In addition, the element is used to produce high-octane gasoline in petroleum refineries. Its isotopes also have applications in different fields. Re-186 and Re-188 are used to treat liver cancer while experimental treatment of pancreatic cancer, which is a malignant cancer, involves Re-188. One of its compounds, methylrhenium trioxide, which is a type of inorganic compound and a colorless, volatile solid, is a good catalyst of ethyl diazoacetate reactions and is used in laboratory settings. When it comes to toxicity, the health effects of exposure are insufficiently studied. Exposure may cause respiratory problems, burns, and skin and eye irritation. Overexposure may cause suffocation and dizziness. Some compounds of rhenium have been tested in laboratory conditions and showed low levels of toxicity. These are rhenium trichloride and potassium perrhenate. The element has no biological role. "
76,Osmium,Os,190.2,"Osmium Osmium (atomic number 76, symbol Os) is a brittle, hard metal that belongs to the platinum family. The element has several oxidation states - +8, +3, +2, etc. Besides osmium, the +8 oxidation state has been reported for several elements only - plutonium, iridium, xenon, and others. Osmium has a very high density and low compressibility. It is difficult to process or form when in solid state due to its high melting point and hardness. Osmium is a lustrous, silvery metal which is unaffected by acids, water, and air at room temperature. Solid osmium dissolves with molten alkalis, but the spongy or powdered metal releases osmium tetroxide. Osmium tetroxide is very toxic and can cause eye and skin damage and lung congestion. The extraction of the metal is time-consuming and complex. In ores, osmium occurs mixed with silver, ruthenium, and other metals. The extraction of other metals such as platinum and rhodium is often the main goal, with osmium being a byproduct. Preliminary treatment is necessary so that other metals can be removed. Osmiridium and iridosmine are the most important ores of osmium. Iridosmine, which is a rare mineral, is mined in South and North America and Russia. The production of osmium is less than 100 kg a year. Generally, iridosmine contains a larger percentage of osmium.Depending on the composition and the type of separation method being used, there are different ways to extract osmium. One technique is through fusion with sodium peroxide and another is through dissolution in hydrochloric acid. Treatment with sodium hydrogen sulfate is then required. The mixture contains iron, osmium, and ruthenium, and sodium oxide is used to treat it. Iron is insoluble and produces osmium and ruthenium salts which are water-soluble. The metal is used as a catalyst in different alloys. It is used in alloys because of its volatility and high toxicity. The alloys of osmium are hard and are mainly used in electrical contacts, pivots of instruments, and nib pens. An alloy of 10 percent osmium and 90 percent platinum is used for pacemakers and other surgical implants. While potassium osmate and osmium tetroxide are poisonous, they are used as oxidants for chemical synthesis. The metal is typically sold in the form of a 99 percent pure powder. It is measured in grams and troy ounces similar to other precious metals. Its price depends on the supplier and the quantity offered. Osmium tetroxide is a very toxic compound which should be handled by experienced chemists only. The compound can enter the body by ingestion or by inhalation of its vapor or aerosol. Inhalation causes shortness of breath, wheezing, headache, cough, and visual disturbances. Skin burns result in blisters or skin discoloration. Osmium tetroxide can cause eye damage, which results in loss of vision, blurred vision, and pain. If the compound is absorbed by ingestion, this can lead to burning sensation, cramps, collapse, or shock. Repeated or long term exposure is dangerous. The compound is toxic and causes damage to the respiratory tract, the skin, and the eyes. Prolonged or repeated exposure may cause lung oedema and dermatitis. Corn oil or other vegetable oils can be used to reduce osmium tetroxide to an inert compound.  "
77,Iridium,Ir,192.217,"Iridium  is a chemical element and a slivery-white, brittle, and very hard transition metal. It is the most corrosion-resistant metal, and the second-densest element, belonging to the platinum family. While some halogens and molten salts are corrosive to iridium, it can be flammable and is more reactive when in the form of iridium dust. Iridium was discovered by Smithson Tennant in 1803, who named the element after the goddess Iris. The scientists who studied it created soluble salts by dissolving the element in a mixture of nitric and hydrochloric acids (aqua regia). The French chemists Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, Antoine François, and Victor Collet-Descotils observed the element as well, but they didn’t obtain quantities large enough to continue research. This element is among the rarest found in the earth’s crust, and the total production and consumption per year is about 3 tonnes. The only isotopes of iridium, which occur naturally, are 193Ir and 191Ir, and they are also the only stable isotopes of the element. Iridium-193 is more abundant than iridium-191. In its pure form, the element is very hard to machine and very brittle. The main application of iridium is as a hardening agent of platinum. High temperature equipment such as crucibles is made from platinum-iridium alloys. Alloys made of osmium and iridium are used to produce elements of fountain pens. Given that this element is corrosive-resistant, an alloy of 10 percent iridium and 90 percent platinum was used to create the standard meter bar. In fact, most of the applications of iridium are based on its corrosion resistance, hardness, and high melting point. Iridium, osmium-iridium alloys, and iridium-platinum alloys are used to make multi-pored spinnerets. Osmium- iridium alloys are used for balances and compass bearings. Heat resistance and corrosion make this element a good alloying agent. Deep-water pipes are made using an iridium-titanium alloy due to its corrosion resistance, and an iridium alloy is used to make certain long-life parts for aircraft engines. In platinum alloys, the element is employed as a hardening agent. In addition, thermoelectric generators are produced using iridium. They are made for unmanned spacecraft like Pioneer, Viking, Voyager, Galileo, Cassini, and New Horizons. Plutonium-238 fuel is encapsulated using iridium because of its great strength and ability to withstand temperatures of 2000 °C.  Iridium is mostly used in the chemical, automotive, and electronic industry. It has application in special and scientific equipment and in pivot bearings, but it is mainly employed in alloys. In the environment, iridium can be found in idrosmine, iridium-osmium alloys, and as an uncombined element. Most of the iridium nowadays in found on the territory of South Africa. The reserves of iridium have not been estimated. This element is highly flammable and if it comes in contact with the eyes, it may cause irritation. Standard industrial handling poses low hazard when it comes to skin contact, but ingestion of iridium may cause irritation. It is, however, a low ingestion hazard. Products should not be allowed to reach the sewage system, water bodies, and ground water. Little is known about the level of toxicity of iridium compounds because they are not used in large amounts. However, iridium halides and other soluble salts can be hazardous. Most compounds of iridium are insoluble, making absorption difficult."
78,Platinum,Pt,195.084,"Platinum  (atomic number 78, symbol Pt) is a precious, dense metal and one of the rarest elements on earth. It is found in gold-bearing deposits in the USA, Columbia, and the Ural Mountains. Platinum is ductile, malleable, silvery-white or gray-white in color, and non-reactive. It occurs as a free element and in the composition of the mineral sperrylite. Platinum is a byproduct from the extraction and processing of copper and nickel. When copper is electro-refined, platinum group metals, gold, silver, tellurium, and selenium settle in the form of anode mud. Platinum group metals are obtained during the next steps of the extraction process. Platinum is less malleable than gold and more ductile than elements such as silver and gold. The element forms hexachloroplatinic acid when dissolved in nitro-hydrochloric acid but is insoluble in nitric acid and solution of hydrogen oxide. It corrodes when reacting with caustic alkalis, sulfur, cyanides, and halogens.The metal is commonly used as a catalyst and in catalytic converters, which combine oxygen with fuel and carbonous oxide. The element has applications in machinery for which high temperature is required. It is also used in fuel nozzles, nose cones for coat missiles, steel piers, and furnaces. In addition, platinum is used to make jewelry because it is resistant to tarnish and wear. The metal has application in the chemical, aircraft, glass, and electrical industries. It is used to produce electrical contact points, liquid crystal display glass, laboratory utensils and surgical tools, as well as optical fibers. Fuel cells use platinum to produce electricity by combining oxygen and hydrogen.Breitling, Rolex, and Patek Philippe and other companies use the metal for watch making. It is mainly used for the production of limited addition series. In addition, platinum has application as an alloying agent for thermocouples, dental prostheses, laboratory containers, and other metal products. Permanent magnets are made from platinum-cobalt alloy. The metal is also used in anodes for pipelines and ships. Platinum has a total of 6 natural isotopes. Platinum-196, platinum-195, and platinum-194 are the most common. All isotopes are non-radioactive or stable, except for platinum-190, which has a long half-life (700 billion years). The metal forms two main types of compounds – oxides and halides. The most important compound of the element is hexachloroplatinic acid, which has many commercial applications. It is used in the production of mirrors, plating, zinc etchings, as a catalyst, in photography, and to make porcelain coloring. The element occurs in low concentrations in air, water, and soil. Rich deposits of platinum are found in the USA, the Soviet Union, and South Africa. While the metal is non-toxic, platinum salts can be harmful for human health. They can cause hearing damage, bone marrow and kidney damage, cancer, and DNA alterations. Platinum salts also cause damage to the intestines and allergic reactions. Short-term exposure may cause irritation of the throat, nose, and eyes. Long-term exposure to platinum salts leads to skin allergies and respiratory problems. The side effects of platinum should be studied further as the metal is used for the production of different types of implants. These include vascular access ports, joint replacement prosthetics, breast implants, and lumbar discs. Finally, platinum levels increase through car exhausts and are higher in locations of trucking companies, in tunnels, and in garages. "
79,Gold,Au,196.96655,"Gold  has it's name from the Latin 'Aurum', which means shining dawn. What formed this association is not known, because gold has been known to man since antiquity or about 5,500 years. Perhaps the lustrous, shiny, and attractive metal was found by someone early in the morning glittering somewhere and this person, enticed by what they saw, gave it this name. This is a pity, because 'why is gold Au and not G' is the standard question of chemistry students, who are baffled by the odd symbol and even more baffled by what Aurum could possibly mean. While Pure, 24-karat gold is bright yellow in color and extremely malleable, so that it is impossible to make anything out of it. This comes as a great disappointment to rich but stupid people who want jewelry made of pure gold. It is alloyed with metals like palladium, platinum, and copper as to increase its strength. Gold does not lose its bright color, because it does not oxidize in air or water. Gold is one of the group 11 elements, the others being silver and copper. It is among the least reactive solid elements in the periodic table. This is why gold is found naturally in the environment in rocks, alluvial deposits and veins. Sometimes it is also found as a compound with the element tellurium in minerals. Gold can be dissolved by nitro-hydrochloric acid. It dissolves in cyanide’s alkaline solutions and in mercury. Nitric acid dissolves silver but gold is insoluble in it, which is why nitric acid is used to prove the presence of gold in various items. Ever since gold has been known to man, 165,000 tons of it has been mined. The biggest portion of gold is used to make jewelry. A little less than this amount serves as investments, and a small part is used in industry. The metal is a good conductor of electricity and heat and when exposed to air, it does not tarnish. Because of these properties, gold can be used in the production of printed circuit boards and electrical connectors. Gold is also widely used in electronics, electric wiring, and more. It is very effective as a component because it is malleable and resistant to corrosion. In addition, gold is used to make dental fillings, decorative items, and coins. The unit karat is used to measure the gold amount is alloys. One karat equals one part in 24; thus, an 18-karat gold earring contains 6 parts alloy and 18 parts gold. Gold is most frequently found in the oxidation states +1 (aurous compounds or gold (I)) and +3 (auric compounds or gold (III)). The metal is also extremely dense – one cubic meter weighs almost 20 kg. The density of lead is much lower – one cubic meter weighs around 11 kg. Gold has only one isotope that is found in nature. It has 36 known radioactive isotopes, which are synthetic.Gold is extremely valuable and has sustained its value over time, notwithstanding highs and lows throughout the course of history. This is why the gold standard was created. "
80,Mercury,Hg,200.59,"Mercury  (atomic number 80, symbol Hg) is a chemical element known as hydrargyrum and quicksilver. It is a silvery, heavy d-block element with a boiling point of 356.73 C and a freezing point of -38.83 C. This element is the only metal in a liquid state at standard conditions for pressure and temperature apart from bromine. Other metals melt above room temperature, including rubidium, francium, caesium, and gallium. This element is a fair conductor of electricity, but at the same time, it is a poor conductor of heat and has a very low melting point compared to other d-block metals. It does not react with dilute sulfuric acid and most other acids, but aqua regia, nitric acid, and concentrated sulfuric acid dissolve it, giving chloride, nitrate, and sulfate salts. Mercury has 7 stable isotopes. The longest-lived radioisotopes of mercury are mercury-194 and mercury-203, with half-lives of 444 years and 46.6 days respectively. The most abundant isotope is mercury-202. Mercury is mainly obtained from cinnabar and is usually not found as a free element in nature. Half of the world’s supply is produced by Italy and Spain. Other countries that produce mercury are Slovenia, China, and Russia. Mineable reserves are estimated at 600,000 tonnes and annual production reaches around 8,000 tonnes. Regarding applications, the metal is used in scientific instruments, barometers, and thermometers. Mercury vapor is used in advertising signs, fluorescent lamps, as well as streetlights. The element forms alloys with silver, cadmium, zinc, gold, and other metals, which are called amalgams. They are used to create dental fillings, extract gold from ores, and extend the useful life of cell batteries. Mercury forms different compounds such as mercuric oxide, mercuric sulfide, mercurous chloride, and mercuric chloride. Calomel or mercurous chloride is a type of antiseptic that kills bacteria. Mercuric chloride was used for wounds’ disinfection in the past and is a poisonous salt. Mercuric oxide is used in the production of mercury batteries while mercuric sulfide is used to produce vermilion, which is a red paint. Thiomersal, another compound of mercury, is a preservative in vaccines and an organic compound. Mercurochrome or merbromin is a topical antiseptic which is used for minor cuts and scrapes. In cosmetics, thiomersal is used to manufacture massacre. The first US state to ban the use of mercury in cosmetics was Minnesota. In 2008, the state gave it a tougher standard compared to the federal government. In the form of cinnabar, one of the element’s common ores, mercury is used in the Chinese medicine and in other traditional medicines. Studies on safety have revealed that cinnabar can result in intoxication when the ore is heated. While cinnabar is less toxic than other forms of mercury, its use in traditional medicines has not been justified. This metal enters the environment as a result of human activities such as solid waste combustion, smelting, mining, and fossil fuel combustion. The breakdown of minerals in soils and rocks also results in mercury entering the environment. The element has a number of effects on the human body, including chromosomal and DNA damage, damage to brain functions, disruption of the nervous system, and negative reproductive effects, including miscarriages, birth defects, and sperm damage. Damaged brain functions lead to personality changes, deafness, vision changes, tremors, memory loss, and muscle incoordination. In addition, it causes allergic reactions that result in headaches, tiredness, and skin rashes. "
81,Thallium,Tl,204.3833,"Thallium (atomic number 81, symbol TI) is a post-transition metal and chemical element that was discovered in 1861 by Claude-Auguste Lamy and William Crookes. They discovered the element independently by using a new method known as flame spectroscopy. This is a method used to study the composition of chemicals and minerals. Thallium is a lustrous, sectile, malleable, and soft metal that tarnishes when reacting with air. Nitrate and sulfate salts are formed when thallium reacts with nitric acid and sulfuric acid. The element has 25 isotopes and TI-205 and TI-203 are stable. This metal has a hexagonal close-packed structure, and the common oxidation states are 1, 2, and 3. Thallium is found in different ores, including metal-sulfide ores, zinc, lead, and copper. It occurs in minerals found in granites, soils, and clays. Minerals that contain silver, lead, copper, arsenic, and antimony also contain thallium in selenides and sulfides. There are some thallium minerals as well, including lorandite and crookesite. Other minerals include sabatierite, routhierite, hutchinsonite, and gabrielite, the latter of which is found in Switzerland. Minerals such as christite and bukovite also contain thallium. Christite is found in deposits in Nevada, the US, and China while bukovite occurs in deposits in Argentina, France, Sweden, and the Czech Republic. The element is used in glass production and the pharmaceutical industry. It is also used to produce superconductors, photoresistors, and glasses. High-density glasses are produced from thallium, arsenic, selenium, and sulfur. Radioactive isotopes have applications in nuclear medicine, especially nuclear cardiography. Its compounds and salts are used to make metal halide lamps and solutions and in gold plating. Thallium sulphate is used to make rat poison. It is a reagent for research purposes. The element is also used to manufacture thermometers, photocells, and reflective lenses. Pesticides that contain thallium sulphate are banned in the developed countries but still used in some developing countries. The reaction of sulfuric acid and thallium produces sulphate. Thallium is a very poisonous metal and poisoning can occur. The symptoms include severe pain, hair loss, red skin, and brain damage. Exposure occurs through inhalation, touching, and living close to waste sites where thallium is found in higher concentrations. Exposure may result in birth defects and side effects such as temporary hair loss, diarrhea, and vomiting. Thallium also affects major organs such as the kidneys, liver, heart, and lungs. Higher concentrations can cause death. The effects of prolonged exposure are unknown. Accumulation may result in sight disturbances, leg pain, l?ck of appetite, depression, headache, and tiredness.  Nerve and joint pain have been reported as well.  Prussian blue is used to treat the symptoms, absorb thallium, and remove it from the body. The carcinogenic effects of thallium have not been studied. Some mammals are also affected, and thallium has toxic effects on plants. The main sources of pollution include metal sewers, coal-burning plants, cement factories, and others. "
82,Lead,Pb,207.2,"Lead  is a chemical element in the carbon group under number 82. Its symbol is Pb, after the Latin plumbum. As we know, in the past, all the plumbing was made of lead, which results in poisoning and death. Thankfully, it no longer is. Lead is soft and considered a poor metal, which means that it is a metallic element in the p-block. It is not clear why these elements are considered poor metals. What sets them apart from the others is that their electro-negativity is higher while their melting and boiling points are lower than that of transition metals. The other poor metals are tin, gallium, aluminum, bismuth, indium, and thallium. Lead is also considered a heavy metal. Its exposure to air renders it gray in color; otherwise it is whitish and silvery when melted. Some consider lead to be the most stable element of all because of its high atomic number.Lead has three stable isotopes and one unstable isotope. All of them are natural. The first isotope, Pb-204, is slightly radioactive and is considered primordial, meaning that it is older than the Earth itself. This is the unstable one. The stable isotopes – Pb-206, 207 and 208 – are generated from isotopes of the elements thorium and uranium.  Lead is, as mentioned, a metal that has been used since the beginning of time. It is easy to use and extract, being ductile and malleable. It has been used as early as 6400 BC, as evidenced by lead beads found in what is Turkey today. Lead was used with arsenic in the Bronze Age. Lead has many uses to this day, notwithstanding the fact that water pipes are not made of it anymore. It is used in construction, shots, bullets, batteries, and as a shield from radiation. Other uses include in some alloys and in solders. It is useful in dating because its half-life is extremely high. One major use of lead is in the glass of television and computer screens, shielding the viewer from radiation. Other uses are in lead crystal glassware, as weight in sports equipment, in solders, cables, ammunitions, and sheeting. Lead is soft, dense, and malleable. It is very resistant to corrosion, which is why it is frequently used in construction. Adding small amounts of calcium and antimony serves to harden lead. The element does not occur in nature frequently. It is found in zinc, silver and copper ore. Galena is the major mineral containing lead – around 87 percent, more specifically. It is also found in anglesite and cerussite. Lead has disastrous side effects in high levels. It inflicts heavy damage to the central nervous system and causes blood and brain disorders. It accumulates in the bones and in soft tissues. Other unwanted effects include diminished learning abilities, declined fertility in men, and behavioral disruptions in children, including hyperactivity, impulsive behavior, and aggression. Lead poisoning has been documented in antiquity and still occurs to this day.  In fact, this element is 1 out of 4 metals, which have the most serious effects on human health. The element can enter the body through air (15 percent), water (20 percent), and the food (65 percent). Cigarette smoke contains small amounts while foods such as wine, soft drinks, grains, seafood, meats, and vegetables and fruit may contain significant amounts. "
83,Bismuth,Bi,208.98,"Bismuth  is a chemical element and a poor metal, resembling antimony and arsenic chemically. In nature, the element can occur uncombined, but its oxide and sulfide form ores with commercial importance. Bismuth is a silvery white metal, but surface oxide can make it appear pink in color. It is brittle, and its denseness is 86 percent that of lead. Bismuth is a crystalline metal and the most diamagnetic of all. Except mercury, it has a lower thermal conductivity compared to other metals. Bismuth also has the highest Hall effect and a high electrical resistance. In a magnetic field, its electrical resistance increases more than that of other metals. Normally, it is not necessary to isolate the metal in laboratory conditions because it is commercially available. In nature, it is found as bismutite, bismuthinite, and bismite. Bismuth can be a byproduct of gold, silver, lead, copper, thin, and zinc plants. The metal does not have stable isotopes. Bismuth-209 was believed to be the heaviest naturally occurring isotope, but research in 2002 proved that it is unstable. Through alpha decay, the isotope decays into thallium-205. The chemical forms pentavalent and trivalent compounds, but the second are more common. The chemical properties exhibited are like those of antimony and arsenic, but they have a lower degree of toxicity, compared to the derivatives of these metals. The compounds of bismuth are generally subdivided into halides, oxides and sulfides, and aqueous species. The element does not form stable hydrides, unlike other elements like arsenic, phosphorus and nitrogen. Bismuthine is a bismuth hydride which decomposes spontaneously at room temperature. Bismuth also reacts with all halogens and produces trihalides. Bismuth is often mixed with cadmium, iron, tin, lead, and other metals, forming low-melting alloys. They are used in the production of electrical fuses, fire detection systems, and automatic fire sprinkler systems. The bismuth compound bismuth oxide is a yellow pigment used in cosmetics and paints. Bismuth carbonate is used in medicine, treating gastric ulcers and diarrhea. Bismuth oxychloride is employed in the production of bismuth white, which is a pigment. Bismuth telluride is a thermoelectric material and a semiconductor. Bi2Te3 diodes find usage in the production of CPU coolers and mobile refrigerators. Bismuth subnitrate is an element of glazes producing an iridescence. Bismuth is also carrier of U-233 fuel and U-235 fuel, used in nuclear reactors. At room temperature, bismuth oxide has a delta form, which is an electrolyte for oxygen. When temperature drops below a temperature threshold, the delta form breaks down.  Bi-213 is produced by using bremsstrahung protons to bombard radium. An antibody conjugate with the isotope was used in 1997 to treat leukemia patients. It decays with alpha particles emission and has a half-life of 45 minutes. Scientists have also tested the isotope in cancer treatment as part of the TAT (Targeted Alpha Therapy) program. Bismuth is also used in the production of lead-free solders, due to its low level of toxicity. These solders are used in the automobile industry and in copper water pipes and food processing equipment. It is a component in free-machining brasses used for plumbing applications. Other applications are as a component of lubricating greases, a catalyst for the production of acrylic fibers, and a material used for fishing sinkers. "
84,Polonium,Po,209,"Polonium  (atomic number 84, symbol Po) is a radioactive element and a very rare semi-metal. The element has 33 radioactive isotopes, including polonium-208 and polonium-210. It is a scarce element that is produced in nuclear reactors. Neurons are used to bombard bismuth-209, and bismuth-210 is formed as a result. Polonium-210 is created through emission of beta particles. Only 3 isotopes have an appreciable half-life - polonium-210, polonium-209, and polonium-208. The half-life of polonium-209 is 102 years, making it the most stable isotope. It emits alpha particles and decays into lead-205. Polonium-210 also emits an alpha particle and decays into lead-210. This isotope is found in the earth’s crust in small quantities. It can be artificially produced from uranium minerals and ores. The isotope is mainly used to clean dust from camera lenses and photographic films and to eliminate static electricity. Anti-static brushes contain small amounts of polonium-210. It is also used for laboratory experiments in the USA. Neutron sources are created by combining beryllium and polonium-210. Early versions of atomic weapons used such neutron sources. Polonium was used to eliminate static electricity in sheet plastics and has application in photography. Due to the short half-life of the element, it should be renewed annually. Other sources of beta particles are used today because polonium is a radioactive element. Polonium-210, in particular, is very dangerous, and processing requires strict procedures, precautions, and special equipment. The nuclear facilities where uranium and polonium are processed are strictly regulated and monitored as required by international agreements. In 1898, Marie Curie discovered radium and polonium after refining pitchblende. The element was named after Curie’s home country. Regarding its chemical and physical properties, polonium is fairly volatile and silvery-gray in color. The chemical properties of polonium resemble those of tellurium and bismuth. There are no naturally occurring compounds, and polonides and other compounds are synthetically produced. Two types of polonides can be formed – intermetallic and ionic polonides. There are three known halogen compounds, 3 oxides, and 1 hydride. Halogen compounds include polonium hexafluoride, polonium tetrachloride, and polonium dichloride. The metallic form of polonium can be electrodeposited on silver or another metal. It can be also separated from bismuth through fractional distillation. Polonium can enter the human body by breathing, drinking water, and eating. It enters the kidneys and the spleen through the blood stream and accumulates there. Long-term exposure has a negative effect on the function of the liver and the lymph nodes. A small amount of polonium (about 10 percent) accumulates in the bone marrow. Polonium can cause death even in small doses. When radiation poisoning occurs, multiple organ failure occurs because alpha particles affect the bone marrow, kidneys, and liver. The symptoms of poisoning include pallor, throat swelling, and nausea. Polonium poisoning is extremely rare, however. Some speculate that Arafat died due to poisoning. The ribs of smokers contain more polonium than those of non-smokers. Polonium-210 is found in cigarettes and enters the body in higher concentrations than radon. It is present in the urine and blood of smokers and increases the risk for premature death due to cardiovascular disease, cirrhosis, and bladder and liver cancer. Phosphate fertilizers contain polonium-210, which is absorbed by tobacco and other plants. The isotope emits alpha particles and increases the risk for lung cancer. The element is also present in seafood. "
85,Astatine,At,210,"Astatine  (atomic number 85, symbol At) is a radioactive metal, first produced by Emilio Segre, Kenneth Ross MacKenzie, and Dale Corson in 1940. In nature, it is formed by radioactive decay and exists in small amounts because of its short half-life. This element is, in fact, the rarest one to occur naturally, with estimates that no more than thirty grams are found in the earth's crust. Astatine is the heaviest halogen, known to men. It is believed that the metal accumulates in the thyroid gland similar to iodine. Astatine has 20 known isotopes and all of them are radioactive. Other sources point to between 7 and 33 isotopes. The most stable isotope of astatine is astatine-210. Through electron capture, it decays into polonium-210 and through alpha decay astatine-210 decays into bismuth-206. Its half-life is 8.1 or 8.3 hours. Astatine itself occurs as a result of decay of thorium or uranium. Isotopes of lead are the products of its decay. With increasing atomic number and molecular weight, the halogens get a darker coloration. Therefore, the element is a black solid which turns into a purplish, dark vapor when heated. This metal is highly radioactive but the least reactive element from the group of halogens. It would be expected to react with sodium and other metals to form salts. Astatine also forms hydrogen astatide by reacting with hydrogen. The latter forms hydroastatic acid when dissolved in water. The structure of astatine is unknown. The Vanderwaals radius and ionic radius of astatine as well as its density are unknown. Its melting point is 302 °C while its boiling point is estimated at 337 °C. Astatine’s electronegativity according to Pauling is 2.2. The element has not been researched extensively due to the short half-lives of its isotopes. Astatic compounds include carbon tetraastatide, magnesium astatide, and sodium astatide. A number of compounds have been successfully synthesized but in very small amounts. They were researched as thoroughly as possible before disintegration. Dilute solutions of astatine were used to test the reactions, mixed with iodine, which plays the role of a carrier. This ensures there would be enough material to use laboratory techniques like precipitation and filtration.  Research has been carried out mainly at the theoretical level, but these compounds have been studied to be used in nuclear medicine. More reactive and lighter halogens can displace astatine from salts. In terms of uses, astatine has been used in cancer treatment and as a radioactive tracer. The heavier isotopes of astatine have uses in medicine. The alpha emitter Astatine-211 is used in radiation therapy and has a half-life of 7.2 hours. Astatine-211–tellurium has been employed for treatment of mice and has not been found to cause undue toxicity. Phosphorus-32, which is beta-emitting, has no antineoplastic activity. Astatine does not pose risk to the environment because it is not present in the biosphere in significant amounts. The element is not hazardous to human health given that just a couple of micrograms have been produced artificially. Moreover, it has a short-half life. A few nuclear research laboratories have studied astatine but because of its radioactivity, it requires precautions and special handling. Astatine can be produced by using alpha particles to bombard bismuth. Relatively long-lived isotopes are produced as a result. When air is present, the distillation of 211At can take place by heating. "
86,Radon,Rn,222,"Radon   It is an odorless and colorless noble gas that forms as a result of the decay of uranium in water, rock, and soil. It can enter premises and residential units through cracks in the foundations, walls, and floors. Radon is a tasteless radioactive gas at room temperature. The half life of radon-222, which is the most stable isotope, is less than 4 days. Isotopes such as Rn-224, Rn-210, and Rn-211 have a short half life of more than 1 hour. There are 7 known isotopes and 0 oxidation states. Radon is soluble in gases and has low electronegativity. It has a cubic crystal structure and is the densest of all gases. Radon is used for cancer treatment in some hospitals and facilities in the form of radon spas, inhalation therapy, drinking therapy, and radioactive water baths. Inhalation therapy is offered in the U.S., Romania, Poland, and Austria while radioactive baths are found in the Czech Republic. Treatments are also offered in mines and curative tunnels, including inhalation, steam, and other therapies. In many facilities, the gas is also used as a pain reliever, but scientists consider these therapies controversial. It is usually administered through transcutaneous resorption and inhalation.  Most of the gas inhaled is subsequently discharged while the remaining amount stays in the body. These therapies are not approved in many counties primarily because consensus cannot be reached on the amount of carbon that is considered safe. The acceptable levels vary from one country to another, and one method of reporting is pico curies per liter. In addition to medical treatment, radon is also used in geologic and hydrologic research. It has been hypothesized that the gas can be used to predict earthquakes. It is also useful in identifying geological faults.The gas and isotopes such as radon-22 are considered health hazards because of their carcinogenic properties. Radon levels are higher in residential homes and premises that are tightly sealed and insulated. There are high concentrations in soils that contain elements such as radium, thorium, and uranium. The concentration is also higher in underground premises, first floors, and basements. According to some researchers, long-term exposure increases the risk for leukemia, but further research is necessary to confirm the findings. There are no signs or symptoms which indicate that radon poisoning has occurred, making it difficult to detect and treat. However, exposure increases the risk for lung cancer, with symptoms such as frequent lung infections, wheezing, shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing up blood being red flags. Radon is present in groundwater, wells, and air but higher concentrations are found in indoor locations. The main ways to reduce indoor concentrations include installing efficient ventilation systems, radon sump systems, as well as sub-slab depressurization. There are kits that allow homeowners to measure radon levels at home. They can be found in many hardware stores and are inexpensive. Different methods are used in public facilities, including radon mitigation strategies. When it comes to environmental pollution, most compounds are released in the atmosphere as a result of production and other human activities. "
87,Francium,Fr,223,"Francium  and is under number 87 in the periodic table. It used to be known as actinium K and eka caesium and has a metallic color. The chemical properties of francium resemble those of caesium. It is the least electronegative of all the elements in the periodic table, meaning that its atoms are very, very unlikely to attract electrons and thus form negative ions. This is due to the distance of its electrons from the nucleus and its atomic number. What is more, francium is the rarest element that occurs in nature but one. The most rarely occurring one is astatine. This element is extremely radioactive and decays into radon, radium, and astatine. It is classed in the group of the alkali metals. Also known as Group 1 metals, the group of these elements also includes lithium, rubidium, potassium, sodium, caesium, and hydrogen. The last one is an untypical member of the group, even though it is considered a member. All of these elements are located in the s-block, meaning that their outermost electron lies in the so-called s-orbital.  Francium was discovered in 1939 in France by Marguerite Perey. It was named after the country, of course. This is the last natural (not synthetic) element that has been found by scientists. The element is very rare. Small parts of it can be found in the ores of thorium and uranium. More specifically, one of its isotopes can be found in these ores. Very little of it can be found in the Earth’s crust – 30 g at the most at any point in time. None of its other isotopes can be found in nature, and it does not have stable isotopes.Francium itself is very unstable. Its least volatile isotope, francium-223, has a half-life of just twenty two minutes. Through alpha decay, it decays into astatine-219, and through beta decay into radium-223. This element is also the least stable compared to each synthetic element prior to element number 105.Given that francium is so rare and not enough of it occurs naturally, researchers have to produce the element as to study its properties. Thorium is bombarded with protons to produce francium or alternatively, radium is bombarded with neutrons. Notably, francium has not been isolated in its pure form. Any amount produced is predicted to decompose due to its high radioactivity. Francium is a very heavy element. In fact, its equivalent weight is the highest compared to those of all other elements. It is not clear what the melting point of this element is because it is extremely rare and radioactive. Some researchers claim that its melting point is around 27 °C. The element is probably liquid because as other radioactive elements, it gives off heat. Therefore, its boiling point is not known either. Being so rare and unstable, this element has practically no applications. It can be used for basic research only. Its application as a diagnostic aid for different types of cancers has been researched, but this was found impractical. On the positive side, this element has a pretty simple atomic structure and can be easily cooled, trapped, and synthesized. This is why it has often been used in spectroscopy experiments. Data from these experiments shows a number of interesting transitions between atomic energy levels. "
88,Radium,Ra,226,"Radium The element is silvery-white in color and emits radiation. Scientists have reported over 12 nuclear isomers, and Ra-221 to Ra-234 are isomers with longer half lives. The element emits gamma, beta, and alpha rays and decomposes in water, forming the compound radium hydroxide. The boiling point is 1140 °C (2084 °F) and the melting point is 700 °C (1292 °F). Its ionic radius is unknown. The element is soft and lustrous and shares similar properties with barium. It is a solid metal with a body-centered cubic structure. This metal is used for medical treatment, including cancer treatment. Radon gas, which is produced through radioactive decay, is used in radon spas for therapeutic purposes. Radon therapy is offered in Russia, Austria, and other European countries (mostly in Central Europe). One of the isotopes, radium-223 is used to treat bone metastases and prostate cancer. The survival for patients who receive treatment is 14 months and 11 months for patients who are given placebo. Side effects have been reported, including foot swelling, vomiting, diarrhea, and nausea. Practitioners also report incidences of neutropenia, lymphocytopenia, anemia, and other conditions.  In the past, radium was added to different products, including food ingredients, hair creams, and toothpastes. In addition, the element was used to produce paints for clocks, aircraft switches, watches, etc. Isotopes such as caesium-137 and cobalt-60 are more commonly used today because they are safer to manipulate. Titrium has replaced radium in the production of paints. During the Second World War, radium was mainly used because it made gauges and dials in airplane visible to pilots at night. The metal is also used in scientific research in combination with beryllium.Radium is present in small concentrations in the environment but levels have increased because of industrial operations, including uranium mining and coal burning. The amounts accumulated in air and soils are unknown, however. Both radon gas and radium are radioactive, and precautions should be taken. Exposure increases the risk for cancer and other debilitating and serious conditions. The effects of exposure depend on the amount of radium in air, soil, and water. Good ventilation is required at storage facilities so that radon gas does not accumulate. In general, this element is volatile although it is a heavy one. While no health effects have been reported at low levels, high levels increase the risk for conditions such as cataract, anemia, and teeth fractures. Some studies also suggest that exposure increases the risk for cancer and premature death. Skin contact also causes ulcers to develop. Some researchers even claim that Marie Curie developed aplastic anemia while handling radium. Exposure to gamma radiation occurs through inhalation and ingestion. Radon, however, is a more serious health hazard because it accumulates in buildings. The metal and its salts are water soluble, and higher concentrations are present in some areas. It also accumulates in aquatic plants and fish. "
89,Actinium,Ac,227,"Actinium  (Ac, atomic number 89) is a radioactive element discovered in 1899. It was the first such element not found in nature to be isolated. Radon and radium and their distinctive properties were noted before those of actinium, but these elements were isolated in 1902. The actinide series (15 elements that are of similar type) is named after actinium. Actinium was discovered by Andre-Louis Debierne, a French chemist. He extracted it from the residues left by Marie and Pierre Curie following their discovery of radium. In 1902, Friedrich Oskar Giesel discovered actinium independently. He described it as an element similar to lanthanum and called it emanium, but its earlier name was retained. The name actinium is derived from aktis, which means “beam” in ancient Greek. Actinium glows in the dark with a pale blue light, which is typical of radioactive elements. The color is a result of its reaction with oxygen. The chemical compounds of the element are AcF3, AcCl3, AcBr3, AcOF, AcOCl, AcOBr, Ac2S3, Ac2O3 and AcPO4. Actinium is soft and silvery-white in color. It has a fast reaction with oxygen. Uranium ore contains some very small amounts of actinium – about 0.2 mg per ton. It is impossible to separate the actinium from the ore. Actinium is derived following neutron irradiation of 226Ra in a nuclear reactor. This metal is very rare and expensive and has a short half life. On top of that, it is radioactive and thus there is not much practical use for it. Scientists have recently started using it for radiation therapy targeting cancer cells in the body. It is also used as a source of neutrons. Scientific research is one of the main applications of actinium. This element can be extremely dangerous, especially in the hands of someone with no experience in handling radioactive substances. Thus, consumers should avoid interacting with actinium. Due to its immense radioactivity, actinium is being actively studied for use as an active element of thermoelectric generators in spacecraft and other industries. Apart from using it in the potential treatment of cancer, medical researchers also apply it to produce 213Bi in a reusable generator. 213Bi is an isotope of actinium. However, this isotope has a half-life of just 46 minutes, making it rather unsuitable for radiation therapy. A better option is the isotope 225Ac, which has a half-life of 10 days. The residual products of this isotope can also be used, because they emit alpha particles that can kill cancer cells in the body. This potential function was probed, but unfortunately, it emerged that injections of actinium complexes led them to accumulate in the bones and liver for decades. This means actinium does indeed kill cancer cells, but eventually new mutations may form. Actinium 227 is very radioactive and as dangerous as plutonium when speaking of radiation-induced health issues. Ingesting even small quantities is a serious hazard to health. After extended exposure, even low doses have a cardinogenic effect. Persons exposed to radiation may suffer from leukemia, immune system damage, stillbirths, miscarriages, and fertility problems. Radiation has been identified as a cause of sterility. Given that Actinium 227 is very radioactive, it can cause damage to the gene pool of all living creatures, not only humans. Moreover, radiation-related genetic damages have a cumulative effect over generations and lifetimes. "
90,Thorium,Th,232.038,"Thorium  (atomic number 90, symbol Th) is a metal and chemical element with radioactive properties. It was discovered by Jons Berzelius and Morten Esmark in 1828.Thorium is an actinide metal that is ductile, soft, and silvery in color. It has a face-centered structure and is very reactive. The element forms different compounds, including halides, hydroxides, oxides, and chalcogenides. Thorium reacts with bismuth, antimony, arsenic, nitrogen, and other elements. Its boiling point is 8654 F (4790 C), and its melting point is 3182 F (1750 C). There are 6 isotopes that occur in nature, and Th-232 has the longest half life. The most common oxidation states are 4, 3, 2, and 1. This is an abundant element which is found in minerals such as thorium silicate, thorianite, monazite, and others. The metal is also found in minerals such as betafite, gadolinite, titanite, and zircon and in soils and rocks. In fact, many minerals contain small amounts of thorium and it is found on all continents. Different methods of production are used, including electrolysis, extraction, and decomposition. Sodium hydroxide is used to decompose minerals such as monazite.  Thorium and its compounds have many applications and can be used as nuclear fuel. It is also used to produce refractory materials and alloys. One of its compounds, thorium oxide is used to produce nitric acid from ammonia and to manufacture glass and high-temperature cubicles. The element itself has applications in radiometric dating and is used to make ceramics and thorium mantles. Mantles are produced in facilities that have been relocated to the developing countries. Thorium is added to ophthalmic lenses and used to make welding rods. Alloys that contain thorium are used to make aerospace components. Exposure occurs through breathing, drinking water, and ingestion.  Skin contact and smoking substances with thorium content are other routes of exposure.  Naturally occurring thorium is found in animal and plant life, water, soil, and rocks. The element also contributes to radiation. Synthetically produced isotopes are rarely found in the environment. Thorium is usually released but small amounts get deposited in the bones. Overexposure increases the risk for liver problems, pancreas and lung cancer, and lung disease. Exposure is also associated with an increased risk of bone cancer. As a rule, the extent of exposure depends on factors such as health status, lifestyle, family traits, sex, and age. Other factors include route of exposure or pathway, duration, and dose or level. People working or living near contaminated sites are at a higher risk. High levels of thorium are measured near industrial plants, government facilities, and mining areas. Special tests are used to measure exposure. Equipment is usually found in specialized laboratories and some state facilities. Persons working near contaminated sites use special equipment. Professionals such as radiation safety officers and health physicists who handle thorium are trained to detect and measure it. Water content is usually measured in analytical laboratories."
91,Protactinium,Pa,231.05,"Protactinium  (atomic number 91) is a metal discovered by Oswald Gohring and Kasimir Fajans in 1913. It was only in 1934 when the element was first isolated. Protactinium-231 was discovered by John Cranston and Frederick Soddy and Lisa Meitner and Otto Hahn in 1918. This metal is found in uranium ores while its isotopes are present in uranium-238 and uranium-235. Protactinium is a rare metal that reacts with inorganic acids, water vapor, and oxygen. It is toxic, radioactive, and harmful for human health. Because protactinium is a rare element, it is not used for commercial purposes and only for scientific research. There are no stable isotopes, and protactinium-231 is the most stable one. The element has 5 naturally occurring isotopes and 29 isotopes in total. Protactinium is shiny, malleable, and silver-gray in color. The ionic radius, boiling point, and Van Der Waals radius are unknown. It is solid at room temperature and has orthorhombic crystal structure.  As a member of the actinide group, it is found in animals and plant species, groundwater, rocks, and soils. Protactinium can be obtained as a byproduct of plutonium, thorium, and uranium and is produced through nuclear fission. Barium, lithium, and calcium fluoride are also used to obtain protactinium at high temperatures of about 1400 °C. It is a conductor with paramagnetic properties and was previously called brevium because of the element’s short life. The oxidation states in solutions and solids are +5 and +4, and the metal forms different compounds with red, yellow, brown, black, and white color. The metal forms insoluble and soluble solids in solutions and has an oxidation state of +3 in compounds such as nitrides and hydrides. The element also forms compounds such as pentoxide, dioxide, fluoride, chloride, and others. Protactinium is found in ores in Zaire and the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has been extracted from waste at the UK’s Atomic Energy Authority. Spent nuclear fuel is also used to extract the metal. In households, it is found in smoke detectors in the form of protactinium-233 which is the product of decay of neptunium-237. The isotope itself has a half life of only 27 days (in comparison, the half life of protactinium-231 is over 32,000 years). While the metal has no commercial or industrial applications, some of its isotopes are used in different fields. Combined with thorium-230, protactinium-231 is used by scientists for radiometric dating, which is a method for dating carbon and rocks. Other possibilities have been explored such as the use of isotopes to study climatic conditions in different historic periods as well as the building of nuclear weapons. Due to the fact that this is a rare element, it is also expensive – 1 gram of pure protactinium costs about $280. Exposure occurs through breathing, drinking water, and ingestion. When ingested, a very small amount of the metal remains in the body and enters the bloodstream. The element is deposited in the kidneys, liver, and bones and is considered a health hazard. Because of its radioactivity, exposure can cause cancer, and protective equipment is required when handling. A glove box is usually used for different manipulations. While ingestion is more common, gamma exposure and inhalation are major risk factors. One of its isotopes, protactinium-213 is very toxic and according to scientists, its toxicity is 2.5×108 higher compared to hydrogen cyanide. Actinium-227 is also considered a health hazard. Because of the fact that protactinium is present is small amounts, it is not a major soil or water contaminant. "
92,Uranium,U,238.03,"Uranium  (atomic number 92, symbol U) is a metal and chemical element which occurs in nature as three isotopes - U-234, U-235, and U-238. The metal was discovered in 1789 by Martin Klaproth, a German scientist who also isolated cerium and zirconium. Uranium forms different compounds such as carbonates and oxides, including triuranium octoxide, uranium trioxide and dioxide, and others. Some of the carbonates are water soluble. It reacts with different metals and forms intermetallic compounds, solids, and solutions. There are several oxidation states, 1, 2, 5, 6, 3, and 4. Uranium is electropositive, ductile, malleable, and silvery-white in color. It has a boiling point of 7468 °F (4131 °C) and melting point of 2070 °F (1132.2 °C). The metal has an orthorhombic structure and is radioactive. It tarnishes quickly when exposed to air. Uranium is found in water, rocks, air, and soil in low concentrations. The element occurs in different minerals, for example, coffinite, torbernite, uranophane, and autunite. There are different recovery methods, and uranium is mainly extracted in ion-exchange and heap leach facilities, in situ recovery facilities, and uranium mills. Conventional uranium mills use chemical and physical techniques for extraction. The mining sites are equipped with evaporation ponds, tailings impoundment, process tanks, and mill buildings. In situ recovery facilities employ chemical techniques for extraction and are used to exploit underground deposits.  Surface facilities and features include deep injection wells, evaporation and storage ponds, processing facilities, pipes, header houses, extraction wells, groundwater injection wells, and other features.  Pumps, pipes, and evaporation systems are used for waste disposal.  Licensed facilities are used for permanent storage. Heap leach facilities use chemical and physical processes, and shallow open pits and deep underground shafts are used for uranium mining. The main producers are Russia, Niger, Namibia, Australia, and Canada. Uranium has different applications and small amounts are found in household items, photographic chemicals, light bulbs, and ceramic glazes. It is also used to make nuclear weapons and in nuclear power facilities. The element is added to compasses and missile vehicles and is used in microscopy techniques such as TEM which has applications in nanotechnology, materials science, virology, cancer research, as well as semiconductor research. Different radiometric dating techniques are used to estimate age, including uranium-lead and uranium-thorium dating. Exposure can cause liver damage and cancer. Toxicity and internal radiation occur after long-term exposure to isotopes found in air, water, and food. Uranium may enter major organs and systems such as the bones, kidneys, bloodstream, and lungs and may cause organ damage. There are tests to detect uranium in stool and urine samples, and officers use specialized equipment that helps measure uranium levels in the environment. While people are normally not exposed to high concentrations, persons living or working near industrial facilities, weapon facilities, and mining areas may be at risk. Small amounts are found in root vegetables such as radishes and potatoes when unwashed."
93,Neptunium,Np,237.05,"Neptunium  (atomic number 93, symbol Np) is a radioactive element belonging to the actinide series. It is a fairly reactive metal with silvery color, and at least 3 allotropes exist. Of all actinoids, neptunium is the element with the highest density.  It is a ductile metal that forms a number of chemical compounds. Chemically, neptunium is very reactive and is attacked by acids, steam, and oxygen, but not by alkalis. It exists in different oxidation states from neptunium (II) to neptunium (VII). Neptunium has no commercial application, but Np-237 is used in devices that detect high-energy neutrons. The element has a long half-life, which makes it a key contributor to radiation. It is not clear what will happen to containment over a long period of time. If scientists find a way to mobilize nuclear waste and extract neptunium, this would minimize damage and environmental pollution. The element was first produced by Philip H. Abelson and Edwin M. McMillian at the University of California. The researchers used slow moving neutrons to bombard uranium and produced the isotope neptunium-239. It had a half-life of around 2.4 days. Discoveries of neptunium were falsely reported as ausonium and bohemium in 1934 and later as sequanium in 1939. The search for this element was encumbered because scientists used the periodic table to predict the chemical properties of neptunium. The actinides series were not included in the periodic table, and this placed uranium below tungsten, protactinium below tantalum, and thorium below hafnium. The periodic table suggested that eka-rhenium, as it was often named, should be similar to rhenium and manganese. Because of this misconception, it was impossible to isolate neptunium from minerals. The isolation of small quantities of the element was attempted in the late 1930s. Otto Hahn and his colleagues confirmed the chemical properties and production of uranium-239, but the researchers were unsuccessful at detecting and isolating neptunium. Neptunium has four oxidation states - +3, +4, +5, and +6. Its ionic radium and Vanderwaals radius are unknown. The element has 8 isotopes but none of them is stable. One of its isotopes, neptunium-237 is fissionable and decays into thalium-205 and bismuth-209. This is unlike other heavy nuclei that form lead isotopes. The decay chain of neptunium is referred to as the neptunium series. Neptunium, like americium, plutonium, uranium, and protactinium, forms a dioxo neptunyl core in +6 and +5 oxidation states. Artificial neptunium-237 is produced through the reaction of lithium or barium vapor and 237NpF at a temperature of around 1200 °C. Neptunium is mainly extracted as a by-product of plutonium and from nuclear fuel rods. The element has 19 radioisotopes, and the most stable ones are Np-237, Np-236, and Np-235. All remaining radioisotopes have a half-life of less than 4.5 days. The main decay mode after Np-237 is beta emission and before is electron capture. The main products after Np-237 are plutonium isotopes and before are uranium isotopes. The element is found in uranium ores in small quantities and occurs naturally on earth. It plays no role in living organisms and is never encountered outside research laboratories and nuclear facilities. Some studies have indicated that exposure to neptunium can lead to bone cancer. It is mainly deposited in the bones and small amounts are retained in the liver. "
94,Plutonium,Pu,244,"Plutonium Plutonium (number 94, symbol Pu) is a radioactive element that is artificially produced and is present in some uranium ores. Its processing is difficult because of the presence of many allotropes. Plutonium enters the environment through release from weapon production facilities, nuclear reactors, and research laboratories. It is also accidentally released during the disposal of radioactive waste, transportation, and use. The release of plutonium in the environment results in soil and water contamination. Low concentrations are also absorbed by plants. The element was discovered by Edward McMillan, Joseph Kennedy, and Glenn Seaborg in 1941. They used deuterons, which are nuclei of deuterium, to bombard uranium-238. The reaction created free neutrons and an isotope of neptunium, neptunium-238. The isotope decayed through emission of beta particles into plutonium-238. Scientists considered names such as extremium and ultimium, but the element was named after Pluto, a dwarf planet in our Solar System. Plutonium-244 is the most stable isotope of the element. It decays into uranium-244 through emission of alpha particles and through spontaneous fission. There are 11 isotopes in total, including plutonium-236, plutonium-246, and others. The element has 6 known allotropes which differ in crystal structure and density. The alpha allotrope has a monoclinic crystal lattice while the beta has monoclinic, body centered one. The crystal lattices of the gamma and delta prima allotropes are orthorhombic and face centered and tetragonal and body centered, respectively. The element’s ionic radius, Van Der Waals radius, and electronegativity according to Pauling are unknown. Plutonium is a reactive element that is dissolved in perchloric acid, hydroiodic acid, and a solution of hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid). The element is sensitive to changes in chemical composition and temperature. It is a paramagnetic element, and its structure is monoclinic. The element is silvery in color and has a poor thermal and electrical conductivity. Plutonium and its isotopes have application in the production of nuclear weapons and mixed oxide fuel. It can be used in the manufacturing of radiological weapons which spread medical waste and other radioactive materials. MOX fuel contains depleted uranium (with low content of uranium-235), reprocessed and naturally occurring uranium, and plutonium. Plutonium-238 is an isotope that can be used for the generation of electrical power and for the production heart pacemakers. Plutonium is a health hazard when inhaled, and it absorbs quickly in the blood. Once a radiation dose has entered the lungs, it can accumulate in the liver and bones. While media describes it as the most dangerous chemical, scientists disagree on this. Botulism toxin, released by Clostridium botulinum, and radium are more toxic and radiotoxic than plutonium. Botulism toxin, which causes muscle spasms, migraine, and cervical dystonia is billions of times more toxic. The exposure to alpha particle radiation increases the likelihood of developing lung cancer. Plutonium is carried to the liver, bones, and other organs and increases the risk for cell damage and cancer at the affected sites and organs. People who inhale or ingest weapons-grade plutonium are at risk of developing cancer. Long-term exposure and overexposure to plutonium also lead to reproductive problems. When inhaled in large amounts, plutonium can cause death due to poisoning. It can remain in the body for a long period of time, with radiation causing cancer. "
95,Americium,Am,243,"Americium  (symbol Am, atomic number 95) is an element of the actinide series, which is named after the element Actinium. It is found under the element europium in the periodical table and was named after the continent America for convenience. The synthetic element was first produced in 1944 by a team of researchers from the University of California. It is most commonly produced by directing alpha particles toward uranium or plutonium in nuclear reactors. Minute quantities of Am are found in used nuclear fuel. Like the element that gave its name to the series, of which Am is part, this element is soft and silvery-white in color. Its best-known and most frequently found isotopes are 241Am and 243Am. They have the oxidation state of +3 in chemical compounds, especially in solutions. Other oxidation states they can be found in range from +2 to +7. This element was the fourth transuranium one to be discovered after neptunium, plutonium, and curium. Transuranium elements are those elements with atomic numbers greater than 92, which is the number of uranium. They are all unstable and decay into other elementsIn terms of usage, the element is often employed in commercial smoke detectors, neutron sources and industrial gauges. Its most common application is in smoke detectors. With smoke entering between the electrodes, the soot particles absorb the alpha radiation. The current is then interrupted, which starts the alarm. The element is also used as target material in particle accelerators and nuclear reactors, for crystal research, and as a source for gamma radiography. One of its isotopes, 242mAm, has the potential to serve as a nuclear battery or fuel for space ships. The isotope, however, is very rare and expensive, which could be a problem. One isotope of practical interest is Americium-241, which gives off gamma and alpha rays when decaying. Alpha rays are not good at traveling far in air. However, gamma rays are much like X-rays in that they are penetrating. These rays can be put to use in various portable machines. For example, they can help determine the places where oil wells can be dug. In view of compounds, no compounds of americium have a commercial use. This element was successfully isolated from its oxides in the following way. To begin with, plutonium-239 nitrate was placed on platinum foil, evaporated, and what was left was transformed into plutonium dioxide. Following cyclotron irradiation, the film was mixed with nitric acid and then precipitated as the hydroxide. The residue was dissolved in perchloric acid. Ion exchange was done to derive a special isotope of curium, after which curium and americium were separated. The researchers from the University of California came to refer to this process as delirium, because it was really difficult and prolonged. In fact, it may have indeed induced madness in some members of the team, but these aspects have not been documented. The isotopes of americium include 241Am, 242Am, 239Am and 238Am. The first was derived directly from plutonium after absorption of a neutron. The second was produced by bombarding the first with neutrons. An interesting fact about Am is that certain quantities of it were present in the fallout from the Ivy Mike nuclear test. Concentrations of the element have been found on the site of Chernobyl and other nuclear incidents. "
96,Curium,Cm,247,"Curium  was named after Marie and Pierre Curie. It is a synthetic chemical element with the symbol Cm and atomic number 96. It is radioactive and part of the actinide series. This element was first identified in the summer of 1944 by a research group at the University of California. Information about this was not disseminated until a year had passed. Curium is mainly created by using neutrons to bombard uranium in nuclear reactors. The metal is hard and silvery in color. Curium oxidizes easily. It has multiple oxides and forms highly fluorescent complexes with different organic compounds. This metal is very dangerous. It can accumulate in the liver, lungs, and bones and cause cancer. All the isotopes of this element are radioactive. They generate x-particles, whereby heat is released, which in turn a source of electricity used in radioisotope thermoelectric generators. However, the isotopes of this substance are rare, expensive, and highly radioactive. It is also used to make pacemakers, more specifically in the power source. Curium has been widely used in space technology – it is a source of alpha particles in the X-ray spectrometers, which were used on Mars 96, Mars, Athena, Spirit, Sojourner, and Opportunity rovers with the purpose to determine the composition of the rocks on the Moon and Mars. The major application of curium, however, is in basic scientific research. The main isotopes of curium include curium bromide, curium trioxide, curium iodide, and curium chloride, among others. Similar to curium, they do not have commercial applications at present and are mostly used in scientific research. Curium is one of the most radioactive elements that can be isolated. Its main isotopes are 242Cm and 244Cm. They have short half-lives and produce a high amount of thermal energy. As a result, curium can serve well in radioisotope thermoelectric generators for spaceships and space shuttles. Currently, the isotope 244Cm seems to be a better bet because the other isotope is extremely rare and one gram costs around two thousand dollars. Another isotope, curium-243, also exists, but it emits harmful gamma and beta rays. The isotope 242Cm can also be used to produce 238Pu, which is more suitable for use as a thermoelectric generator. Bombarding the isotope 248Cm with oxygen (18O) or magnesium (26Mg) can generate some isotopes of seaborgium (265Sg) and hassium (269Hs and 270Hs). Curium was also used when the element californium was discovered. This occurred when a miniscule target of curium-242 joined with 35 MeV alpha particles through a 60-inch cyclotron. The experiment was also conducted at Berkeley. Several thousand atoms of californium were produced in this experiment.Finally, a few words about safety – it is important to handle curium and its compounds with utmost caution. Due to its radioactivity, the element and its compounds should be handled under special arrangements in laboratory settings. Some decay products of curium emit gamma and beta radiation, thus requiring elaborate protection. If it enters the body, curium is released within a couple of days, and only 0.05 percent of it is absorbed in the blood stream. Curium’s biological half-life is fifty years in the bones and twenty years in the liver. The amount absorbed goes to the liver and bones and accumulates in the bone marrow. It prevents blood cell formation because curium radiation destroys the bone marrow. "
97,Berkelium,Bk,247,"Berkelium  (atomic number 97, symbol Bk) is a synthetic element, named under Berkley in California where the Radiation Laboratory of the University of Carolina is found, in which the element was discovered. Berkelium was discovered after americium, curium, plutonium, and neptunium and belongs to the transuranium and actinide series. Berkelium is a silvery-white and soft radioactive metal. No practical uses have been found so far, outside of scientific research. Studies are directed at the synthesis of transactinides and transuranic elements. One isotope, berkelium-249 is safe to be handled because it emits low-energy electrons. Its half-life is 330 days after which it decays to californium-249. The latter is a dangerous and strong emitter of alpha particles. This fact is important to know because the formation of californium is associated with self-heating, radiation damage, and chemical contamination. The element was first produced in 1949 by Albert Ghiorso, Kenneth Street, Jr., Glenn T. Seaborg, and Stanley G. Thompson. They bombarded americium-241, which is an isotope of americium, with a device called cyclotron, using alpha particles. In this way, 2 free neutrons and berkelium-243 were formed. The most stable isotope of berkelium is berkelium-247, with alpha decay transforming it to americium-243. Its half-life has been reported at around 1,380 years. Berkelium chloride, which is a berkelium compound, was first created in 1962. Other compounds have been identified and researched as well through X-ray diffraction, including berkelium dioxide, berkelium fluoride, berkelium oxychloride, and berkelium trioxide. There are no known applications of the compounds of berkelium, apart from scientific research. Compounds can be generally divided into halides, oxides, organometallic compounds, and inorganic compounds. Berkelium (III) and berkelium (IV) fluoride are halides. Berkelium (III) has 2 crystalline structures and a yellow-green color. Berkelium (III) is an ionic, yellow-green solid, which is isotypic with zirconium (IV) fluoride and uranium tetrafluoride. The boiling point, melting point, Vanderwaals radius, and ionic radius are unknown and so is its electronegativity according to Pauling. There are some 10 isotopes and all of them have been found to be radioactive. Berkelium does not occur naturally and is not present in the earth’s crust. For this reason, it does not pose hazard to human health. Given their radioactivity, the isotopes of berkelium involve health hazards, although they can be produced only in laboratory conditions as of yet. The following considerations involve radioactivity, however. The development and production of nuclear technology has been associated with small and substantial releases of radioactivity in the seas, oceans, soil, and atmosphere. Radiation affects species and passes through the food chain, subjecting humans and animal life to its damaging effects. This rare radioactive element is of no commercial importance. Berkelium has nuclear fission properties but they are different from those exhibited by californium and curium. These properties indicate that berkelium will not perform well when used as a fuel in nuclear reactors. Berkelium-249 has been researched to this purpose, but its fission cross section was found to be low for thermal neutrons. Berkelium-247 has the ability to maintain chain reactions in a fast neutron reactor and a thermal-neutron, but its production involves some complex processes. Its availability was found to be significantly lower compared to its critical mass. Finally, there is some evidence that it may accumulate in the skeletal system. "
98,Californium,Cf,251,"Californium  is a radioactive element from the actinide series, named after the University of California and California. It is a grey or silvery white metal, and its density is greater than the density of lead. Californium does not occur in nature, and particle accelerators and nuclear reactors are used for its production. Californium is also a byproduct of the production of plutonium and different radioactive decay and neuron capture routes. Californium-249, an isotope of californium, occurs with beta decay of berkelium-249 and the high-numbered or heavier isotopes are typically produced in nuclear reactors, using intense neutron irradiation. Californium-251 is the most stable isotope of californium, and its half-life is 898 years. Given this short half-life, the isotope does not occur in the earth’s crust. The most common isotope of californium used is californium-252. It is produced in Russia’s Research Institute of Atomic Reactors and the US Oak Ridge National Laboratory. While californium has not been detected in nature so far, small amounts of the metal may be found in some of the uranium ores. Some have suggested that californium can occur with stellar explosions, but this has not been confirmed. Californium was produced in laboratory conditions using helium ions or alpha particles to bombard curium. The element was discovered at the University of California in 1950. Given its radioactivity, californium is a health hazard only if it enters the body. Risk, however, is associated with californium-251 and californium-249 which emit gamma rays. The main sources of exposure are water and food that contain isotopes of californium as well as breathing in californium-contaminated dust. Given that californium enters the body more easily when inhaled, as opposed to ingested, the two routes of exposure can prove important. Cancer is a major health concern, which can result with californium isotopes emitting ionizing radiation. It can be deposited in the liver and on bone surfaces. Under pressure below or above 900 °C (normal pressure), there are 2 crystalline forms of the element, with a third one existing at high pressure. At room temperature, the element will tarnish slowly in air. There are different applications of this chemical and its isotopes. Californium-252 is a neutron emitter, making californium a non-reactor based or portable neutron source, which used for the analysis of neutron activation, as well as a neutron start-up source in some types of nuclear reactors. Analysis of neutron activation helps detect the level of elements in different samples. Californium neutrons are also used to treat some brain cancers and cervical cancers for which radiation therapy proves ineffective. Californium is also used with bulk material analyzers and elemental coal analyzers in the cement and coal industries. The ability of californium’s neutrons to penetrate into materials has been used in aircraft neutron radiology, weapon components used to detect trapped moisture, cracks, bad welds, and corrosion, fuel rod scanners and other detection instruments, as well as in portable metal detectors. Californium-252 is used in neutron moisture gauges as to detect petroleum and water layers in oil wells. These are also used as a neutron source in on-the-spot-analysis for silver and gold prospecting. Finally, these are also used to detect movement of ground water. Californium-252 has been mostly used for fuel rod scanning, neutron radiography, reactor start-up, and activation analysis. "
99,Einsteinium,Es,252,"Einsteinium  is a synthetic element (not found in nature) with an atomic number 99 and symbol Es.  The element was discovered in 1952 in Berkley, California, by G.G. Harvey, A. Ghiorso, S.G. Thompson, and G.R. Choppin. In fact, einsteinium was discovered through a thermonuclear explosion test, which was conducted in the Pacific. The test took place at Enewetak Atoll on November 1, and it was the first successful hydrogen bomb test. The debris produced from the explosion contained a new isotope of the element plutonium. This isotope was produced through the absorption of 6 neutrons by a nucleus of uranium-238, which was followed by beta decay.Einsteinium is one of the trans-uranic elements, which are elements with an atomic number higher than 92 (all of them are radioactive). It was aptly named after Albert Einstein. The most common isotope of Es is Es-253, which is generated in several high-power nuclear reactors, albeit in minute quantities. It is very hard to separate Es from the other elements in the reactor synthesis. Einsteinium has a very short half-life (meaning it disintegrates quickly), which is why all it can be used for is basic scientific research. Es is soft and silvery in color. The density and boiling point of the element are unknown. At room temperature, it is solid. It is paramagnetic, which means it is only attracted to an externally applied magnetic field. Chemically, it is found in the +3 and +2 oxidation states, the latter particularly in solids. Einsteinium is very radioactive, making the element dangerous to work with. This fact also makes the study of its chemical and physical properties hard and risky. It quickly converts to berkelium and then californium on a daily basis, which is another obstacle to scientific research. The density of einsteinium is 8.84 g/cm3, and its melting point is 860 °C. Both its density and melting point are relatively low, and the immense radioactivity of einsteinium is what mainly contributes to this fact. The element has a remarkably high volatility. The metal is also prone to self-radiation and consequently self-depletion, which is why it is sometimes studied under the atmosphere of certain reductant gases so that the sample can in part re-grow as it decomposes. This metal is also very scarce and prone to self-contamination as a result of the fast conversion to berkelium and then to californium. This is why most of the samples of Es are contaminated, and what we know about its properties is frequently deduced from back data. Es has nineteen nuclides and three nuclear isomers, the atomic weights of which range from 240 to 258. The nuclide 252Es has the longest half-life of all - 471.7 days, and it is the most stable isotope of einsteinium. Through electron capture, the isotope decays into californium-254 and through alpha decay, it decays into berkelium-248. Through beta decay, it decays into fermium-252.Einsteinium also has a very high rate of nuclear fission. Nuclear fission is the opposite of nuclear fusion. It is when the nucleus of an atom breaks up into lighter nuclei, thus generating free neutrons and gamma rays, as well as huge amounts of energy. As mentioned, Es can only be produced synthetically. This is achieved by bombarding lighter actinides in high-capacity nuclear reactors with neutrons. "
100,Fermium,Fm,257,"Fermium  that are formed by bombarding light elements with neutrons, it is the heaviest. It has 19 isotopes. The isotope fermium-257 has the longest half-life of all - 100.5 days. This element is highly radioactive, toxic, and risky to handle.The element Fm was named after the nuclear physicist Enrico Fermi. It is one of the elements that were found to be by-products of the hydrogen bomb explosion in 1952. It is a typical actinide chemically, found in both +3 and +2 oxidation states. Due to the small amounts of this element that are produced and its easy self-disintegration, it is used for little else than basic scientific research. While fermium is not produced commercially, it may have uses in medicine in the future. Fermium has not been produced in sufficient quantities so far as to analyze its properties. Researchers predict that it is a slivery-colored metal, which is susceptible to attack by acids, steam, and air. In an aqueous environment, only the three oxidation state exists. While fermium does not occur in nature, it has occurred in the past. It does not pose health hazards as it is not found in the earth’s crust. In terms of annual production, it amounts to no more than milllonth of a gram. The various isotopes of fermium have atomic weights varying from 242 to 260. They include fermium-253 with a half-life of 3 days, fermium-251 with a half-life of just 5.3 hours, fermium-252 of 25.4 hours, fermium-254 of 3.2 hours, and fermium-256 with a half-life 2.6 hours. The rest have half-lives from half an hour to less than one millisecond. The most stable isotope of fermium is fermium-257, which decays via spontaneous fission or through alpha decay into californium-253. Similar to other synthetic elements, fermium isotopes are highly toxic and very radioactive. Fermium is not found in nature independently, but always in combination with other elements. It is generated synthetically in a nuclear reactor. The heaviest isotope, fermium-257, with the longest half-life, can only be created in very, very small amounts. After it is produced, fermium has to be separated from the other elements in the actinide series and from other lanthanides. This can be done by means of a process called ion exchange chromatography. This is where a cation exchanger is mixed in with ammonium alpha-hydroxyisobutyrate. The element crystallizes and breaks off. The nuclear fallout in 1952 was thoroughly analyzed for all kinds of trans-uranium elements. These studies were held because multiple neurons have to be captured in order to synthesize such elements from uranium. Nuclear explosions result in a very powerful surge of neutron production and provide fertile ground for such studies. In fact, around 1029 neutrons are found per cm². Fm was the heaviest element found. Studies were held in Nevada a decade later after a controlled explosion in a confined space took place. The results from these studies were somewhat disappointing because it proved hard to isolate the elements discovered. This is because the explosion drove the majority of them deep underground – up to 600 meters – and it took a long time and a lot of money to drill to such depths.   "
101,Mendelevium,Md,258,"Mendelevium  (atomic number 101, symbol Md) is a radioactive and synthetic element in the actinide series. It is named after Dmitri Mendeleev, whose periodic system classifies all chemical elements. IUPAC or the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry accepted the name mendelevium. The element has 16 isotopes with masses from 245 to 260. The most stable isotope is mendelevium-258, and it has a half-life of 51.5 days. The isotope decays into einsteinium-254 through spontaneous fission or alpha decay. Mendelevium-257 has a half-life of 5.52 hours and mendelevium-260 - a half-life of 31.8 days. The other radioactive isotopes of the element have half-lives of less than 97 minutes. Mendelevium has five meta states, and mendelevium-258 is the long-lived of them. Mendelevium-256 has been used to study the chemical properties of mendelevium in an aqueous solution. The element itself was first synthesized by Stanley Thompson, Bernard Harvey, Gregory Choppin, Glenn Seaborg, and Albert Ghiorso at the University of California in 1955. The research team of Stanley Thompson produced mendelevium-256 with a half-life of 87 minutes. The team used helium nuclei (alpha particles) to bombard einsteinium-253 in a 60-inch cyclotron. Mendelevium-256 was the first isotope synthesized by the researchers – 1 atom at a time. The ion-exchange adsorption-elution technique was used to create and analyze the first 17 atoms of mendelevium. During the experiment, the element behaved like its homologue thulium. In 1975, Rosengren and Johansson predicted that mendelevium, similar to ytterbium and europium, would prefer a divalent metallic state and not a trivalent state. Trace amounts of mendelevium were used in thermochromatographic studies to confirm that the element forms a divalent metal. The researchers estimated a divalent metallic radius.  To remove mendelevium atoms from the collector foil, dissolution of gold foil or thin etching was used. Mendelevium atoms can be isolated and purified using different techniques and from other products. Trivalent actinides can be separated from La carrier and lanthanide fission products using a 10 percent ethanol/ 90 percent water solution saturated with hydrochloric acid as eluant. Hydrochloric acid is used to separate mendelevium from the catcher foil. Actinides such as mendelevium pass through while gold remains on the column. Ammonium salts were used to treat a cation-exchange resin column as to separate fractions that contain elements 101, 100, and 99. The elusion position was used for the purpose of chemical identification (just before Fm). The density and boiling point of the element are unknown. Its ionic radius and Vanderwaals radius are also unknown. Its melting point is at 1521 °F or 827 °C. There is no data on its magnetic ordering, and its appearance is unknown. A standard atomic mass is not available because mendelevium is a synthetic element. Similar to other synthetic elements, mendelevium does not have stable isotopes.  This element is classified as a metal, and it is solid at room temperature. Its oxidation states are +2 and +3, and its ionization energy is 6.58 eV. Its electron shell configuration has been confirmed. Transferium elements do not have economic role or application. They have unstable nuclei and do not occur in nature. For this reason, they are quite difficult to detect or make. Mendelevium health hazards are not a source of concern given that it is not found in the earth’s crust. "
102,Nobelium,No,259,"Nobelium  (atomic number 102, symbol No) is a synthetic element identified at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in 1966. It is a radioactive metal with a half-life of 58 minutes, of which only a few atoms have been isolated. Californium was bombarded with carbon to produce the element. Nucleosynthesis has been studied and attempted - by cold fusion and hot fusion. As decay products, its isotopes have been studied during the process of decay of heavier elements. Researchers at the Nobel Institute in Sweden announced the element's discovery in 1957. The research team used C-13 nuclei to bombard Cm-244 and reported that they isolated a nobelium isotope with a half-life of 10 minutes. They retracted their claim later and explained that the activity was associated with background effects. The synthesis of nobelium was claimed by John Walton, Glen Seaborg, Torbjørn Sikkeland, and Albert Ghiorso in 1958. The team used C-12 and C-13 ions to bombard curium and detected decay of Fm-250. However, the researchers were unable to confirm the activity claimed by the Swedish team. Finally, researchers at the FLNR identified decay of a parent nucleus and were able to detect Fm-250. Further research at Berkley (1967) and Oak Ridge (1971) confirmed the discovery of nobelium. Following the Berkley results, the IUPAC recognized and ratified the name nobelium to commemorate Alfred Nobel. This element forms a trivalent ion and a stable divalent ion in a solution. It is most likely gray and metallic or silvery-white, but its appearance is unknown. Nobelium is solid at room temperature and belongs to the group of actinides. Its density, boiling point, ionic radius, and Vanderwaals radius are unknown. Its 3rd, 2nd, and 1st ionization energies have been measured. The element has two oxidation states (+2 and +3), and its ionization energy is 6.65 eV. Chemical data is limited to its isotopes, half-life, and atomic number. The atomic weight of the known isotopes of nobelium ranges from 249 to 262. According to some sources, the element has a melting point of 827 °C, but this has not been confirmed by official sources. Initial research assumed that nobelium reacted like other actinoids and formed a +III state. Later, it was discovered that the element formed a stable +II state. The ionic radius of the hexaaquanobelium (II) ion is 110 pm. Nobelium has 12 radioisotopes, and the most stable one, No-259 has a half-life of 58 minutes. It decays into mendelevium-259 through electron capture and through alpha decay, the isotope decays into fermium-255. No-261 and No-263 are expected to have longer half-lives. Nobelium may pose a radiation hazard if produced in sufficient amounts. It has no commercial applications or uses outside basic scientific research because only small amounts have been produced. Generally, the group of transferium elements has no economic role or application.  They have unstable nuclei and do not exist in nature, which makes them hard to detect and make. Nobelium does not occur naturally and because it is unstable, it would quickly decompose to other elements. Thus, it is not considered a health hazard. It is a toxic element due to its radioactivity and has no biological role. The reserve base distribution, the country with the largest reserve base, and its crystal abundance are unknown. There are no known allotropes. "
103,Lawrencium,Lr,262,"Lawrencium  is a member of the actinide series in the periodic table. It has the symbol LR and is under number 103. Lawrencium is a radioactive synthetic chemical element, which is also known as a period 6 d-block element. It is similar to lutetium in composition and to the other elements of the actinide series. Lawrencium does not appear freely in nature in its natural form. It was derived by a team of scientists from the University of California in 1961. The element was first produced by bombarding isotopes of . It was named lawrencium after the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, where it was first produced, and after Ernest Lawrence, being the inventor of the cyclotron. Another team of scientists at the University of California conducted a study in 1971 with the aim to establish the nuclear decay properties of the isotopes of this element.The main isotope of lawrencium is lawrencium-262, the half-life of which is only 3.6 hours. This isotope decays into nobelium-256, either through spontaneous fission or through electron capture. The rest of its isotopes have a half-life of less than a minute, except for lawrencium-262, lawrencium-261, and lawrencium-260. One isomer and 11 isotopes of the element have been synthesized, and lawrencium-262 is the heaviest of them. Larencium-252 is the lightest isotope of the element synthesized so far. Other compounds of this element include lawrencium trichloride and lawrencium chloride. Lawrencium forms a trivalent ion just like the other actinide elements. Lawrencium is the first member of the 6d-block in the periodic table. This element can appear in gas and in liquid form. A team at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in the then-Soviet Union used the nuclear reaction 243Am+18O to generate nuclei of lawrencium. When they brought this substance into contact with chlorine gas, a gaseous chloride product was formed. This substance was labeled 256LrCl3. Most actinides are in the f-block series. Only lawrencium is in the d-block. Very little of it has ever been produced, and it thus has no known uses outside scientific research. Notably, lawrencium is highly radioactive. This means its atomic nucleus loses energy after generating ionizing particles. Usually, this happens because of a chemical interaction inside the nucleus. Sometimes, however, one of the inner electrons of the atom plays a role in the configuration.The process of radioactive decay is random, meaning that one cannot make predictions about when it will happen. The probability of decay is consistent over time. The loss of energy occurs when the atom transforms into a different type of nucleus. In general, lawrencium has an unstable nucleus and is difficult to detect and produce. The atomic weight of the element is 262. Its melting point is 1900 K (1627°C or 2961°F). Its density, ionization energy, and boiling point are not known. Its ionic radius and Vanderwaals radius are also unknown. The element is in a solid state at room temperature. Given that it does not occur naturally, it is unstable, and is hasn’t been found in the earth’s crust, the element does not pose health hazards. The reason is that any amount of lawrencium formed decomposes to other elements quickly. Because of its short half-life, the element is not hazardous to the environment. "
104,Rutherfordium,Rf,267,"Rutherfordium  (atomic number 104, symbol Rf) with temporary name Unnilquadium - Unq, is a synthetic chemical element i.e. it is synthesised, not found naturally. Rutherfordium or unnilquadium has an atomic number of 104 and atomic weight of 267. The element is highly radioactive and artificially generated. The element's initial (and officially recognised name) honours the scientist Ernest Rutherford). Unnilquadium's most stable isotope - 267 Rf has a half-life of about one point three hours. Although the chemical properties of unnilquadium are still unknown, scientists believe this metal would work well with other elements of Group 4 in the periodic table. Group 4 includes elements such as hafnium, zirconium, titanium, and others. Unnilquadium’s melting and boiling points are still unknown to researchers, so is its density. At room temperature, Unq is in a solid state. The element has a hexagonal close-packed structure, and common oxidation states include 2, 3, and 4. The discovery of Rutherfordium follows the same beaten path of other chemical element discoveries of the 60s and 70s - namely a dispute between the scientific communities of the USSR and USA. And of course, the controversy over the element's name. Almost simultaneously, in the 60s Unnilquadium was discovered by both an American and Russian scientist at each country’s respective institutes – the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia and the University of California, USA. The American discovery was independently confirmed in 1973, while the Russian team was criticized for altering and amending their findings in the course of the dispute in order to make research data more credible. Interestingly enough, the Russian science team leader did not deny this. The American science community supported the name Rutherfordium for element 104 while the Russian science community suggested the element be named Kurchatovium. The IUPAC working group tasked with settling such disputes in the name of greater science announced that both parties did actually present valid evidence of discovering element 104 at pretty much the same time, and decided that both sides should be credited for the discovery of Unnilquadium. The Americans weren’t too happy about IUPAC’s official decision and insisted the Russians altered their findings for over twenty years. In response, IUPAC said they did everything necessary to confirm the discovery of element 104, and that their competence and unbiased decision making was not at stake, or in any way compromised by the claims coming from the American science group. However, IUPAC eventually decided to name element 104 Rutherfordium which does indicate a possible change of opinion. IUPAC officially stuck to the name Unnilquadium – the name derived from the Latin names of the digits 1, 0 and 4.  Since there are only small amounts of Rutherfordium produced, and because of its super short half-life, the element cannot really be used for anything other than basic in-lab research. The element decomposes quickly and is not considered a health or environmental hazard. "
105,Dubnium,Db,268,"Dubnium , is a synthetic chemical element, and its most stable isotope which is dubnium-268, has a half-life of approximately 28 to 30 hours.At the moment, the chemical properties of unnilpentium are only partially known to scientists, however, they do believe the element will have properties similar to those of other Group 5 elements of the Periodic Table. Currently, the boiling and melting point, as well as the density are still unknown. According to the element classification, Db or Unp is a radioactive metal. At room temperature, the element is in a solid state. This is a transition metal which decomposes quickly because it is unstable. It can be synthetized through hot and cold fusion. Some isotopes have been identified, including Db-256, Db-257, Db-261, Db-266, Db, 270, and others. As the usual practice at the time was – the discovery and naming of the element was the object of much dispute between former rivals USSR and USA. Officially, minute amounts of unnilpentium were discovered in the 60s and 70s in labs in Dubna, USSR and California, USA. The dispute between Russian and American scientists over who discovered it and whose name it should bear, dragged on for decades, all the way up to the mid-90s, when IUPAC decided that ‘dubnium’ is the element’s official name (Dubnium showing that the element 105 was indeed discovered in Dubna, Russia).In 1968, a team of Russian scientists at the Dubna facility used neon-22 ions to bombard an element called Americium-243 which produced element 105 – later to be known as dubnium. In the next two years, the Russian science team refined and continued their experiments. At the same time, an American science team lead by Albert Ghiorso (responsible for the discovery of element 106 and many more) synthesised unnilpentium at the University of California in Berkley, through a reaction between Cf-249 and N-15.The American experiment conducted in California did not confirm or support the data generated by the Russian team sometime earlier. It was possible that the Russian scientists had generated only one of the isotopes of element 105, but not unnilpentium itself. The naming of element 105 caused a bit of unrest and dispute between scientific societies on either side of the Iron Curtain. As the case was, with many other chemical elements discovered at the time, element 105 was given two distinctly different names. The Russian scientists favoured the name nielsbohrium in honour of the Danish professor and nuclear physicist Niels Bohr. The Americans, however, did not approve and wanted to call element 105 – hahnium in honour of Otto Hahn. Temporary name was: Unnilpentium - UnpThere are no practical uses, and the element is only used in scientific research and lab settings. Dubnium is not considered a health hazard and has no biological role. "
106,Seaborgium,Sg,271,"Seaborgium  is a synthetic element with symbol Sg and atomic number 106 also known by its temporary name Unnilhexium or Unh. Seaborgium comprises of a number of isotopes, some more stable than others. At this stage, certain characteristics of this synthetic element are still unknown, others however have been observed and recorded. Seaborgium has an atomic weight of 271. Its melting and boiling point are still unknown and so is its density. The element is in a solid phase when kept at room temperature. Sg is metal as per its element classification. Its period number is 6, and its group number is 7. It has no specific period group name. This synthetic element is radioactive and artificially produced in controlled environment.Seaborgium is made up of isotopes, and its most stable isotope is seaborgium-271 which has a half life of two point four minutes. The isotope decays into rutherfordium-267 through a process called alpha decay or it decays through naturally occurring fission. The element is named after the scientist who first discovered it – Glenn Seaborg. The discovery of th? synthetic element is directly related to its naming. The first ever discovery was in 1974, by a team of scientists at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research – a specialised facility in the former USSR. In the summer of 74, the science team reported the discovery of element 106. A few months later, in the autumn of 1974, a synthesis of Unnihlexium was also reported by a team of researchers at the Super HILAC particle accelerator at the Lawrence/Berkley Laboratory. The team was led by scientists Albert Ghiorso and Kenneth Hulet.In 1993, an official inquiry into the discovery of this element confirmed that the research team at Lawrence/Berkley were indeed the first ones to discover it. The American team which discovered the element, decided to name it in honour of the American chemist Glenn Seaborg who was actually responsible for the discovery of many other elements prior to this particular discovery, though he was also credited as part of the same research group which found Unh through synthesis. Naming the element stirred a fair bit of emotion and controversy in scientific societies in the US and the rest of the world. Bodies like IUPAC decided to use the name Unnil?exium as the element’s temporary systematic name. In 1994, the same organisation decided to rename Unh to Rutherfordium and adopted a rule of thumb that no element can be named after a living person. Naturally, the rule provoked a lot of controversy and objections from other scientific societies – after all einsteinium was in fact chosen as a name of another element, whilst the scientist was still alive.In terms of use and application, Unh has still got no known uses as there were only a few atoms of the element ever generated. At this stage, Unh is only used in basic scientific research."
107,Bohrium,Bh,270,"Bohrium  is a chemical element with symbol Bh and atomic number 107. This artificial chemical element is radioactive and does not occur naturally. Currently, element 107's melting and boiling points are unknown to scientists, so is its density and other properties. Classified as metal by the element classification system, unnilseptium takes solid state at room temperature. The most stable isotope of unnisleptium is Bh-270 which has a half life of approximately one minute. While there are no stable isotopes, the most stable ones are Bh-267, Bh-270, Bh-271, and Bh-274. All isotopes have a half life of 1 second up to 1 minute. The element is produced in lab settings by using chromium-54 to bombard bismuth-209.Although the chemical and physical properties of element 107 are still only partially known, it is believed that it works well with other elements of Group 7 of the Periodic Table. The element’s official name as per IUPAC is bohrium. It has a hexagonal close-packed structure and is classified as a transition metal. This is a heavy metal which is believed to be steel gray in color. Official discovery of bohrium or unnilseptium happened in 1981, by a German team of scientists at the Institute of Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt. The team was led by well-known German scientists Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Munzenberg – responsible for the discovery of other synthetic chemical elements, object of naming and founding controversy; temporary name - Unnilseptium - Uns. The German team who were credited by IUPAC as the official discoverers of unnilseptium proposed that element 107 should be called nielsbohrium, symbol Ns, in honour of Danish particle physicist Niels Bohr. The Russians on the other hand, wanted the name nielsbohrium to be given to element 105. IUPAC did actually rename element 105 to dubnium in recognition of the Soviet scientists. This made element 107 nielsbohrium once again. This time around, the Russian science team did not object to the name, as they were happy with the name given to element 105 (dubnium). Eventually, the Danish IUPAC agreed on the name bohrium. Official renaming of element 107 to bohrium took place in 1997. At this stage, there are no known uses or applications of unilseptium, in part because only a miniscule amount of the element has ever been synthesized. However, in 1995, an attempt was made to isolate element 107, though it was unsuccessful. Half a decade later, in the year two thousand, a team of scientists experimenting with unilseptium concluded it was a typical example of Group 7 period element. Currently, the only known application of unilseptium is in basic laboratory experimentation. The element's electron shell configuration is still unconfirmed. Because it decomposes rapidly, the element has no biological role, and there is no reason to believe it is an environmental hazard. At high concentrations, it can be unsafe due to its radioactivity. "
108,Hassium,Hs,277,"Hassium  is a chemical element with symbol Hs and atomic number 108. It is created in controlled laboratory environment but not found in nature. Temporary name was: Unniloctium - Uno.Hassium has atomic number 108. This radioactive element comprises of isotopes, with its most stable one (known so far) being Isotope 269 Hs. The isotope has a half life of nine point seven seconds. However, unconfirmed research has suggested that Isotope 277 Hs may have a longer life span of about 11 seconds in metastable state.The element's boiling and melting point are still unknown. Its density is also still unknown. At room temperature, however, Hs is known to be in a solid state. As per the element classification, Unniloctium is classified as metal. It belongs to period group 8 and bears period number 7. Hassium is a radioactive element which is artificially generated.An attempt to synthesise element 108 was first done by a Russian research party at the Joint Institute of Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia. The team were led by scientist Yuri Oganessian and Vladimir Utyonkov. However, their research data was inconclusive, and some of the facts could not be confirmed through instant repeat of experiments. Nevertheless, the science team continued their research and repeated the experiment five years later. Officially, the Russian experiment was confirmed in 1984. Officially however, element 108 was discovered in Germany, in 1984 by a team of scientists led by Gottfried Munzenberg and Peter Armbruster at the German Institute of Heavy Ion Research, located in Darmstadt. Through bombardment, the German team created three atoms of Hassium’s main isotope. As in many other such cases, official discovery and naming of the element stirred up a fair bit of controversy. International regulatory boards and bodies decided to credit the Germans with the discovery of Unniloctium but did admit that the Russian science team did also use element 108 in their experiments, indicating that indeed there was Unniloctium in existence at the time. However, the Russian experiments were unconfirmed, data was inconclusive and not thorough enough, and so element 108 was officially named Hassium – after the Latin name of the German province of Hesse. Although element 108 got its official name, regulatory bodies and boards suggested and recommended it be called Unniloctium as well. Like many other similar elements, only a small amount of Unniloctium atoms have ever been synthesised, and it is believed there are only about one hundred atoms of Hs created to date. Due to this, the use and application of element 108 are limited or virtually none at this stage. This should come as no surprise as scientists are still speculating over the many of the physical and chemical properties of element 108. Researchers believe Hs will work well with other Group 8 elements. In large amounts, Hassium is expected to be a silvery metal which reacts with oxygen forming a chemical known as volatile tetroxide."
109,Meitnerium,Mt,276,"Meitnerium  (atomic number 109, symbol Mt) is a chemical element synthesized by Gottfried Munzenberg and Peter Armbruster at the Darmstadt Institute for Heavy Ion Research in 1982. The team used nuclei of iron-58 to bombard bismuth-209 and detected meitnerium-266. The half-life of this isotope is 0.0038 seconds or 3.8 milliseconds. The most stable isotope of meitnerium is meitnerium-278 and through alpha decay, it decays into bohrium-274. Its half-life is around 11 seconds. The element was originally known as unnilennium and named after the physicist Lise Meitner. IUPAC adopted the name in 1997. This radioactive element is artificially produced. Its chemical properties have not been researched, but they should be similar to those of iridium and other elements of group 9. This group contains the elements meitnerium, iridium, rhodium, and cobalt, which are classified as d-block transition elements. Meitnerium should have a high melting point and be very corrosion-resistant. It should be a heavy metal as well and is projected to be the heaviest member of group 9, after iridium, rhodium, and cobalt. The atomic weight of meitnerium is 278, and it is solid at room temperature. Its boiling point, melting point, and density are unknown. Its oxidation state and ionization energy are also unknown, and its electron shell configuration has not been confirmed. Regarding isotopes, Ken Hulet was the first to attempt the production of long-living isotopes. No product atoms were detected. A research team at LBNL used hot fusion to find an isotope of meitnerium, hoping it would be sufficiently stable so that the element’s chemical properties could be studied. Again, no atoms were detected. Reactions with Th-232, Pa-231, Np-237, Pu-244, and Pu-242 are yet to be attempted. Cold fusion reactions have been used to synthesize nuclei of meitnerium. These processes lead to a higher probability of synthesis at low excitation energy. The excited nuclei decay through the emission of 1 or 2 electrons to the ground state. The first successful reaction was observed by researchers at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in 1982. They identified a single atom of meitnerium-266 by using a parent-daughter correlation technique. The experiment of 1982 was unsuccessful, but in 1985, another team detected alpha decays from Cf-246, which indicated that meitnerium was formed. The research team at the Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research synthesized two atoms of meitnerium-266 in 1988. Measuring the 1n excitation function in 1997, it detected 12 atoms. Meitnerium isotopes have been identified as part of the decay of heavier elements. Researchers have identified 2 atoms of meitnerium-270 in the decay chains of ununtrium-278. The decay energies and lifetimes of the 2 decays are different. One of the isomers decays by emission of an alpha particle and the other by emitting a MeV alpha particle. Because of the limited data, they cannot be assigned to specific levels, and further research is required. The element does not have applications, outside of scientific research, because only small amounts have been synthesized successfully. Little is known about the element, and it doesn’t have known or commercial applications. Since meitnerium is a synthetic element, it is not found free in nature. Given that the element is very unstable, it decomposes quickly and would not have any effects on human health. Because of its short half-life, the element does not pose risk to the environment. "
110,Darmstadtium,Ds,281.16,"Darmstadtium  (atomic number 110, symbol Ds) is a synthetic element first produced at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in 1994. Temporary name was Ununnilium.The properties of Darmstadtium are only partially known to scientists. Its chemical and physical properties have not been sufficiently studied because the element has never been synthesized in pure form. Element 110 has an atomic weight of 281. It is predicted to be at solid state at room temperature, with a body-centered cubic structure. Its density is 34.8 grams per cubic centimeter, which makes it a heavy metal. The high density can be explained with the element’s high atomic weight. It’s boiling and melting points are unknown to date and so is its ionization energy. Scientists predict 5 oxidation states – 0, 8, 2, 4, and 6. The ionic and Vanderwaals radius are also unknown. Some of its isotopes have been artificially produced in research settings, all of them being radioactive. The element has 8 isotopes, among which Ds-277, Ds-273, Ds-271, and Ds-269. Isotopes such as Ds-277 and Ds-286 can be synthesized through the reaction of Ca-48 and Th-232. Some of the isotopes undergo spontaneous decay while others decay through alpha decay. The heaviest and most stable isotope is Ds-281 which has a half life of 11 seconds. This is a metastable isotope which decays through alpha decay and spontaneous fission. None of the element’s isotopes are stable, and only small amounts have been synthesized in research settings. It is expected that Darmstadtium shares properties with platinum, palladium, and nickel. They have high boiling and melting points and are refractory, hard, highly ductile, and silvery-white in color. This is a highly radioactive element which belongs to the group 10 elements. Darmstadtium is heavier than other d-block elements and is considered a noble metal. The element was discovered by the German physicists Gottfried Münzenberg and Peter Armbruster. The team was led by Sigurd Hofmann, a German physicist who made significant contributions to the discovery of elements such as meitnerium, hassium, bohrium, copernicium, and roentgenium. They used Ni-62 to bombard Pb-62, and a single atom of Ds-269 was produced. The team used a lead target and over a billion of Ni ions. At first, the scientists synthesized atoms with a half life of 1/10th of a second and then succeed in synthesizing heavier atoms with longer half lives.  Darmstadtium is named after the city of Darmstadt, and the name was also recommended by IUPAC and confirmed in 2003. Lead and nickel atoms are fused in a heavy iron accelerator to produce Darmstadtium. The element has no known uses because its properties are yet to be studied. It is only used in experimental chemistry. Only a few atoms have been synthesized. The metal has no known biological role and does not occur free in nature. It has no effect on the environment because of its short half life. Samples decay quickly in lab settings."
111,Roentgenium,Rg,280.16,"Roentgenium  (atomic number 111, symbol Rg) is a chemical element named after Noble Prize winner Wilhelm Roentgen who was the first to produce X-rays electromagnetic radiation. Little is known about Roentgenium, but it is predicted that its properties resemble that of other noble metals. The group of noble metals includes elements such as gold, ruthenium, platinum, iridium, silver, and others. Some researchers predict that the element's properties are similar to that of gold. Gold is a noble metal with a purple, yellow, ruby, or black color and is ductile and malleable. It forms acids and chlorides and has good electrical and thermal conductivity. Roentgenium would be orange metallic or yellow in color and has an atomic weight of 281. The element is probably a transition metal and belongs to period 7 elements. Its electron configuration, ionization energies, and crystal structure are unknown. The boiling and melting points and the covalent radius are also unknown. The element is predicted to have a body-centered cubic structure and density of 28.7 grams per cubic centimeter. It should have four oxidation states, -1, 1, 3, and 5. Rg is expected to be solid at room temperature. It is a d-block element like bohrium, niobium, manganese, chromium, and vanadium. Rb has 111 protons which makes it a heavy element. The shortest-lived isotope is Rg-279 with a half life of 0.17 seconds, and the longest-lived is Rg-281 with a half life of 26 seconds. Rg-281 decays to meitnerium-276. The mass numbers of its isotopes range from 272 to 282. The element’s magnetic ordering, shear modulus, specific heat, poisson ratio, and electronegativity are unknown. Its lattice structure and thermal conductivity have not been studied. Roentgenium is a transuranium element which decays radioactively. Other such elements are curium, americium, plutonium, nobelium, and fermium. Such elements are produced in small amounts, with few exceptions. Elements with an atomic number higher than 110, Roentgenium in this number, are classified as super heavy. They are usually created through nuclear fission, and a particle accelerator is used. The element was first detected by a research team at the Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in 1994. The team led by Gottfred Munzenberg and Peter Armbruster bombarded Ni-64 nuclei with Bi-209 and isolated a single atom of Rg-272. A heavy ion or linear accelerator was used to target bismuth-209. Only small amounts of Rg have been produced and observed to date. It was in 2003 when the Joint Working Party confirmed the discovery of element 111. The element was named the following year, and the name was confirmed by IUPAC. Given that Roentgenium is a synthetic element, it is not found free in nature. It has no biological role or commercial applications and is of research interest only. The element has an extremely short half life to be considered an environmental or health hazard. In large concentrations, Rg would be harmful and toxic because of its radioactivity. "
112,Copernicium,Cn,285.17,"Copernicium  (atomic number 112, symbol Cn) is a manmade element that was synthesized in 1996 by the German physicist Sigurd Hofmann and the Bulgarian researcher Victor Ninov who also made contributions to the discovery of Roentgenium and Darmstadtium. This is a very radioactive element that is only synthesized in controlled settings. Some of its properties have been studied while others are still unknown. The short half life of the element makes it difficult to study its properties. It is expected that Copernicium exhibits properties similar to radon. The element's oxidation states and ionization energy are unknown. With an atomic weight of 285, this is a d-block element with a density of 23.7 grams per cubic centimeter. Copernicium is a transition metal which is predicted to have 4 oxidation states – 0, 1, 2, and 4. It is produced through the reaction of two isotopes, lead-208 and zinc-70. While the element has no stable isotopes, a number of isotopes have been identified and studied in research settings, among which Cn-283, Cn-282, Cn-281, Cn-280, and others. Cn-285 is the most stable isotope and was discovered in 1999. It has a half life of 29 seconds and decays into Ds-281. It has been predicted that Cn-285b has a half life of 8.9 minutes.  Atoms of Cn-284 and Cn-281 have been detected as decay products of another element – Flerovium. Researchers also predict that Copernicium would exhibit the properties of a noble gas element. It has a hexagonal close-packed structure and is isolated through different nuclear reactions. Copernicium is solid at room temperature and has a high atomic weight. It is expected to be unreactive and was created through fusion experiments. This is a volatile element which is hard to oxidize. It is the heaviest of all elements and it is over 200 times heavier than H. The element was first synthesized at the Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research by bombarding Pb-208 with Zn-70. A heavy iron accelerator was used to create copercinium. The researchers also discovered the elements Darmstadtium, Roentgenium, Meitnerium, Bohrium, and Hassium. The team is now looking for another element – element 120. A single atom of Cn-277 was synthesized with a very short half life of 0.24 milliseconds. Because of its short half life, advanced computerized equipment is required to detect and prove its existence. The element was named after the famous mathematician and astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus in 2009, and the name was confirmed by IUPAC. The symbol Cp was proposed at first but it was ultimately rejected. The reason is that Cp was used for another element, the metal lutetium until 1949. For over a decade, Cn was simply called element 112. This element has no applications because it is very unstable. It is only used in experimental chemistry and basic scientific research. Copernicium has no known biological role. While it is highly radioactive and harmful, only 75 atoms have been isolated so far. "
113,Ununtrium,Uut,284,"Ununtrium  (symbol Uut, atomic number 113) is a chemical element with a temporary name which was discovered in 2003 at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. Ununtrium is predicted to share some properties with elements such as Thallium, Indium, Gallium, Aluminum, and Boron. However, it is expected to behave like a post-transition metal. This is the heaviest element in the boron group and the elements are also known as icosagens. Uut has an atomic weight of 286 and is solid at room temperature. Scientists predict a density of 16 grams per cubic centimeter. There are no stable isotopes, but some of its radioactive isotopes have been isolated in research settings, including Uut-286, Uut-285, Uut-283, Uut-282, and others. Uut-287 is expected to have a half life of about 20 minutes. Another isotope, Uut-293 is expected to be stable toward beta decay, but the isotope is yet to be discovered.  The shortest-lived isotope of Ununtrium has a half life of only 0.24 milliseconds. Little is known about element 113 and its isotopes and possible compounds. The most stable isotope is Uut-286, which has a half life of 20 seconds. Thus, the atomic weight of Ununtrium is based on Uut-286, which is the longest-lived radioactive isotope. The atomic weight could change if an isotope with a longer half life is produced. The second longest-lived isotope, Uut-285 has a half life of about 5.5 seconds.The element is predicted to show several oxidation states – +5, +3, and +2. Its ionization energy, covalent radius, and atomic radius are unknown and so are the melting and boiling points and electron configuration. These properties have only been extrapolated or predicted. The color is unknown but is expected to be gray, silvery-white, or metallic. This is a p-block element. The group comprises sulfur, phosphorus, indium, gallium, chlorine, and other elements. Ununtrium is also predicted to be the most electronegative element in the Boron group. Experiments were conducted in California, the U.S. and Dubna, Russia, and the research teams were led by Ken Moody and Yuri Oganessian. Fusion of americanum-243 and calcium-48 was used to isolate Ununtrium. The reaction produced 3 atoms of Uut-288 and 1 atom of Uut-287. They decayed through alpha decay. These isotopes of Ununtrium are radioactive and decay into isotopes of roentgenium. None of the isotopes identified undergoes beta decay meaning that they do not emit beta particles.The element was first detected as an alpha decay product in 2003. Three names have been suggested – nishinanium, rikenium, and japonium. The Joint Working Group is tasked with approving and confirming the name. There are no known commercial uses of Ununtrium outside of scientific research. The element is used in scientific study only and has no known biological role. It is not found in the geosphere or atmosphere and is not an environmental hazard. "
114,Flerovium,Fl,289.19,"Flerovium  (number 114, symbol Fl) is a manmade element that was discovered at the JINR and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Little is known about the appearance and physical and chemical properties of Flerovium. This element is synthetic, radioactive, and volatile and has an atomic weight of 289. It has 114 protons and 114 electrons and is a period 7 element. Other elements in this group include curium, plutonium, neptunium, and uranium.  This is the heaviest known group 14 element. It is a super heavy element and is predicted to be solid at room temperature. Its ionization energy, atomic radius, melting and boiling points, and oxidation states are unknown.  The element’s ionic and Van Der Waals radius are also unknown and so are its electronegativity, heat of fusion, and heat of vaporization. The element is predicted to have properties similar to tin and lead. Lead is ductile, corrosion resistant, and malleable while tin is corrosion resistant, pliable, and soft. Flerovium's density is pinpointed at 14 grams per cubic centimeter, with 5 common oxidation states – 6, 0, 4, 2, and 1. Estimates predict a boiling point of 297 °F (147 °C) and melting point of 160 °F (67 °C). This is a post-transition metal that belongs to the carbon group, together with elements such as lead, tin, germanium, silicon, and carbon. It is a p-block element, together with tellurium, arsenic, selenium, bromine, and other elements. The element’s volatility is comparable to elements such as copernicium, astatine, and mercury. Some scientists categorize it as a volatile metal.  Flerovium has several manmade isotopes, including Fl-287, Fl-288, and Fl-289. None of the isotopes is stable. The longest-lived isotope of Flerovium has a half life of 2.6 seconds. Nuclear theory predicts that Fl-298 would be more stable than the element itself, but this has not been confirmed. Prior to its discovery, Flerovium was known as Ununquadium (symbol Uuq). The element was produced through a fusion reaction between two isotopes, plutonium-244 and calcium-48. Five billion calcium atoms were used to make a single Flerovium atom.  In 2009, researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory confirmed the discovery of Fl-287 and Fl-286. The team at the Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research confirmed the discovery of two isotopes, Fl-289 and Fl-288 in July the same year. The element was named after Georgy Flyorov, a Russian nuclear physicist and founder of FLNR. The element’s discovery was recognized and confirmed by IUPAC in 2011. Flerovium has no uses outside of experimental chemistry and scientific research. It has no biological role or effect on the environment given the tiny amounts that have been isolated so far. Only 80 atoms have been detected to date. Some were the product of decay while others were artificially produced. Given its very short half life of less than 30 seconds, Flerovium decomposes quickly.  Fl is only produced in nuclear reactors and does not occur in nature. "
115,Ununpentium,Uup,289,"Ununpentium (atomic number 115, symbol Uup) is a synthetic, transuranium element which is very unstable and higly radioactive. It is a super heavy post-transition metal also known as element 115 and eka-bismuth. Ununpentium is the temporary name. This is a 7-period, p-block element and the heaviest known pnictogen. Other pnictogens are bismuth, phosphorus, nitrogen, antimony, and arsenic. They are solid at room temperature, the only exception being nitrogen, and have different crystal structures, densities, and melting points. All elements in this group form covalent bonds. Uup has 115 protons and an atomic weight of 289. Given that new isotopes could be isolated in the future, the element’s atomic weight is provisional. It is a group 15 metal with no stable isotopes. Isotopes like Uup-287, Uup-288, Uup-289, and Uup-290 have short half lives. The half life of the longest-lived isotope, Uup-289 is just 220 milliseconds. Uup-290 has a half life of 16 milliseconds.  Little is known about its physical and atomic properties. The element is predicted to have 2 oxidation states, 3 and 1. Its density is 13.5 grams per cubic centimeter. Its heat of vaporization, phase, heat of fusion, and atomic radius are unknown. It is predicted that Ununpentium forms compounds such as fluoride, oxalate, carbonate, and hydroxide. It would also form Iodide, Bromide, Chloride, and other compounds. Some of the compounds would be soluble while others – insoluble. Until recently, Uup was one of the transuranium elements which were only theoretically thought to exist. The first experiment was conducted by a research team at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. They used Ca-48 to target Am-243 and created 4 Uup atoms.  Element 115 decays into Ununtrium, which is a lighter synthetic element. Ununtrium  further decays into lighter atoms.. The experiment was successfully repeated by a team at the Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in 2013. The existence of 3 transuranium elements was confirmed in 2011 – Copernicium, Roentgenium, and Darmstadtium. A permanent name will be assigned after review by the IUPAP and IUPAC.  The temporary name stands for one-one-five. Heavier isotopes of Uup, Uup-290 and Uup-289 were detected in 2009 and 2010. Ununpentium does not occur in nature because it is a heavy element with a complex structure. It is only used in scientific research and experimental chemistry.  To date, Uup is only used to produce ununtrium. In general, the uses would be very limited because it is a very unstable element. There are no known applications to date. Only a few artificially created elements have commercial applications. Plutonium, for example, is used in space probes and nuclear reactors. "
116,Livermorium,Lv,293,"Livermorium  (atomic number 116, symbol Lv) is an artificially made element which was isolated in 2000. This is a super heavy, highly radioactive element produced by nuclear reactions. Some of its isotopes have been isolated, namely Lv-295, Lv-294, Lv-288, and Lv-285. All isotopes studied so far are unstable. The longest-lived isotope of Livermorium is Lv-293, with a half life of 61 milliseconds. The shortest-lived isotope is Livermorium-290. Its half life is only 7.1 milliseconds. Fusion reactions of Ca-48 and Cm-243 produce lighter isotopes. This is a group 16 element, together with polonium, tellurium, selenium, sulfur, and oxygen. It is expected to have 3 oxidation states – +4, +2, and -2. Little is known about Livermorium and its isotopes. Its density, electron configuration, atomic radius, and heat of fusion are unknown.

Livermorium’s atomic radius is predicted to be 183 pm and its heat of density – 12.9 grams per cubic centimeter. Lv is a transactinide element and should be solid at room temperature. It is the heaviest 16 group element and is expected to share properties with polonium. Polonium is a metalloid and a rare element with radioactive properties. It is a silvery-gray semi-metal which reacts with alkalis and dilute acids. The element also shares properties with tellurium, selenium, and sulfur. Sulfur is a tasteless and odorless nonmetal while selenium is a non-metal found in the form of brick-red powder. Tellurium is a brittle and lustrous semi-metal with a silvery-white color. Livermorium has similar properties to oxygen which is an odorless and colorless gas. The element is predicted to have a melting point in the range of 364 °C – 507 °C and boiling point from 762 °C to 862 °C. Several unsuccessful attempts at isolating the element were made in the late 1990s. Livermorium was first isolated in 2000 by researchers at JINR. They used Ca-48 ions to bombard Cm-248. A single atom was produced which decayed to a flerovium isotope (Fl-289). The discovery of Lv-289 and Lv-286 was confirmed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and GSI in 2009. Two atoms of Lv-292 were also produced. The isotope has a very short half life of just 18 milliseconds. The name ununhexium was initially proposed but scientists called it element 116 prior to discovery. It was named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory which cooperated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research on its discovery. There are no known uses outside of scientific research. It is only synthesized in research settings and does not occur naturally. Because of its very short half life, it is not a health hazard."
117,Ununseptium,Uus,294,"Ununseptium  - Uus has an atomic number of 117. Ununseptium is a temporary name. This is a super heavy element with an atomic weight of 294. It is also known as eka-astatine and element 117. Ununseptium is called element 117 because it has 117 protons and 117 electrons. Elements with such a high number of protons are not found free in nature. The heaviest element that occurs in nature has 92 protons (uranium). Heavier elements are made in research settings by using nuclear reactions to add more protons. Elements with more protons are generally unstable and decay quickly. Given that such elements decay quickly, it is difficult to predict their properties and find practical uses and applications. Scientists experiment with heavier elements to find out whether there are more elements before the island of stability is reached.  Ununseptium should be a metalloid and is one of the heaviest, artificially made elements. Its chemical and physical properties have not been sufficiently studied to date. The element’s density, electron configuration, and atomic radius are unknown and so are the ionization energy, phase, and melting and boiling points. Its Van Der Waals radius and electronegativity are also unknown. Ununseptium is expected to have 4 oxidation states - +5, +3, +1, and -1. The most stable oxidation state is +1 while the other states are less common. It is a group 17 element and is predicted to share properties such as ionization energy and melting and boiling points with other halogens, including astatine, iodine, bromine, chlorine, bromine, and fluorine. Uus is a period 7, p-block element with an expected density of 7.1 grams per cubic centimeter. Other p-block elements are xenon, iodine, germanium, and phosphorus. Ununseptium has several isotopes with extremely short half lives. The longest-lived isotopes are Uus-2293 and Uus-294. The half lives of its isotopes are up to 40 milliseconds. All of the isotopes decay radioactively. One possible compound of Uus is UusH. Transuranium elements such as Ununseptium are synthetically produced, and their atomic number is higher than 92. Transuranium elements such as nobelium, mendelevium, curium, plutonium, and neptunium are produced in laboratories such as the Society for Heavy Ion Research and JINR. They are usually named after world-famous scientists. Ununseptium is the second heaviest transuranium element after ununoctium. Temporary names are assigned prior to confirmation. The first experiment took place in the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in 2009. Two isotopes were detected, Uus-293 and Uus-294. Two years later, scientists were successful in isolating the isotope Uus-289, and the initial experiment was successfully repeated in 2012. Researchers at the Helmholtz Center for Heavy Ion Research confirmed the discovery of Ununseptium during the same year. There are no known uses outside of basic research and experimental chemistry. Uus is not found free in nature, and its environmental and health effects have not been studied. "
118,Ununoctium,Uuo,294,"Ununoctium  (symbol Uuo, number 118) is a synthetic, super heavy, transactinide element, also known as element 118 and eka-radon. Ununoctium is the temporary IUPAC name. Transactinides are super heavy elements such as Livermorium, Flerovium, Copernicium, Hassium, Bohrium, and others. These elements have atomic numbers from 104 to 118. They are also transuranium elements and are artificially produced. With the exception of Dubnium and Rutherfordium, all elements are very unstable and have very short half lives. Like other transactinide elements, Ununoctium is manmade, radioactive, and only produced in laboratories. Systemic names are used prior to discovery and isolation. Permanent names are usually given to these elements by the researchers who contributed to their discovery. Ununoctium’s chemical and physical properties have not been thoroughly studied. Its electron configuration, element category, density, and phase are unknown. Uuo has 118 protons and has the highest atomic mass of all elements. The element is a nonmetal and is predicted to have 6 oxidation states – +6, +4, -1, +2, +1, and 0 and a density of 4.9 grams per cubic centimeter. Its critical point and ionization energies are unknown to science. Ununoctium is expected to behave like a noble gas and is a period 7, p-block element. It is a group 18 element together with noble gases such as Radon, Xenon, Helium, Krypton, argon, and neon.  Noble gases are odorless and colorless and are unreactive. Researchers predict that Ununoctium would have similar properties to that of radon. Radon is a dense gas with low melting and boiling points, which is unreactive and colorless. However, scientists expect that Uuo is more reactive than radon, copernicium, and flerovium. The element has an atomic weight of 294 and is solid at room temperature. There is only one isotope, Uuo-294, which is unstable and has a very short half life. Calculations show that isotopes Uuo-302, Uuo-300, Uuo-298, Uuo-297, and Uuo-295 would be more stable.  No stable isotopes have been produced so far.  No compounds of Ununoctium have been produced but it is predicted that the element would react with hydrogen and fluoride, forming the compounds UuoF4, UuoF2, and UuoH.Two unsuccessful attempts at discovery were made by the team at Lawrence Berkley and the theoretical physicist Robert Smola?czuk. Ununoctium was discovered by scientists at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and researchers at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. They used calcium-48 ions to target californium-249 and created Uuo-294 which has a half life of around 0.9 milliseconds.  The experiment lasted over 1000 hours, and just 3 atoms were produced. The isotope Uuo-294 decays to Lv-290 through alpha decay. It further decays to flerovium-286 which decays to copernicium-282 through alpha decay or spontaneous fission. The isotope also experiences spontaneous fission.  The element was called eka-emanation until the 60s. It was renamed to Ununoctium in 1979. The name given means one-one-eight. Given that Ununoctium is very unstable and super heavy, it has no commercial applications. It is not a health or environmental hazard because the element does not occur in the earth's crust. "
